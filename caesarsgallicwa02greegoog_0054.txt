lines in almost constant motion. The enemy are given no rest and
are worn out by the repeated charges of the cohortS. The third line,
however, is held in reserve, and is brought into action only in case
the other two prove insufficient.

The cavalry in* the rear, or on the wingS, stand ready when the
enemy break and fiee to ride down the fugitives and cut them to
pieceS.

There were times when troops had to be arranged in special forma-
tions, The most important of these were the cuneus, or wedge‚ the
testudo, or tortoise‚ and the orbiS, or circle. The first was an attack
in column instead of in line, and was of use in cutting through and
dividing an opposing battle line. The second, in which the shields
overlapped above like shingles on a roof, was used especially in
approaching and storming waIIS, or whenever the enemy were to be
driven from a higher position (cf. Bk. ii. 6 3 see Fig. 68). The last

· formation was like a modern hollow square with officers in the centre

—except that from the character of ancient fighting it was rather
circular than rectangular. It was necessary when the attack came
from all sides at once (see Bk. iv. 37).

VIII. THE SIEGE.

The Romans excelled in the art of taking walled citieS, and this
skill gave them an immense advantage in their warfare with semi-
barbarous and ignorant peopleS. There were three methods of
doing this: first, by an immediate attack (oppugnatio repentina);
second, by an active siege, brought to a close by an assault (expug-
natio) ; third, by investment and blockade (obsidio).

If there seemed to be a chance of success, a city was stormed at
once with no formal preparation (ex itinere). Its defenders were
driven from the walls by a shower of missiles (Bk. iii. 2 5) 3 the moat
was filled with brush and earth3 the assaulters with shields locked in
a testudo attempted to break open the gates or scale the walls with
ladders.

Is this method proved unsuccessful or impossible, a regular siege
was begun. The work of a regular siege centred about the mound
or agger, and to its‘ construction everything else was subordinated.=

in the rear3 the porta principalis dextra, on the right side; the
porta prz'nczPalzk sinistra, on the left. Between the gates on the
right and left ran a broad street, the via principalis. The forward
half of the camp was allotted to the soldierS, the rear half to the
officers and their attendants, All about the inside of the fortifica-
tions ran a broad space, at least one hundred feet wide, left vacant
for baggage‚ evolutions of troopS, and to protect the tents within from
missiles that the enemy might hurl over the walls, N ear the middle
of the camp was an open square (praetorium), in which stood the
general’s tent (tabernaculum ducis). Before this was the altar on
which he sacrificed, and on the left was a sodded mound of earth
(tribunal or suggestus; cf. Bk. vi. 3), from which he pronounced
judgment and addressed the assembled soldierS. The full details of
the interior arrangement of Caesar’s camp are not known3 but every
officer, every cohort, every maniple, every man had his appointed place.

No night passed that the army was not housed in such a camp,
fortified by wall and ditch. As soon as the soldiers arrive at the spot
marked out for them, laying aside helmet, shield, and spear‚ they
begin to dig the ditch (fossa), the earth from which is used in con-
structing the wall (vallum). If time permitS, the sides of the em·
bankment are covered with sods to hold the earth, or with bundles
of brush (fascines). The ditch was usually nine feet wide and seven
feet deep, the wall· six to ten feet high, and wide enough on the top
to afford good standing room for‘a soldier in action. An ordinary
camp for a night's sojourn could be fortified in about three hours. If
the camp was intended for more than one night (castra stativa), the
fortifications were made stronger. The earth was made firmer by
imbedding in it several lines of fascines parallel to the length, and on
its top was set a breastwork of stakes (valli or sudes,· cf. Bk. v. 403
Bk. vii. 72). This breastwork was about four feet high (see F ig.
1 18). Often wooden towers were erected on the walls (cf. Bk. v. 403
Bk. vii. 72), connected by galleries (pontes). The wall was made
easy of access on the inner side by steps of brush. Sometimes small
redoubts (castella) were built at a distance from the main camp.
These were made on the same general plan.

After the camp had been fortified and the leathern tents (tentoria,
pelles) put up in their assigned placeS, guards were set at the gateS,

and the regular routine of camp life began.

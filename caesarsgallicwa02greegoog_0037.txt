V. PERsoN AND CHARACTER OF CAESAR.

“ Death makes no conquest of this conqueror ·
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.”- Shakespeare.

“ Great Julius, whom all the world admires.” — Milton.

Suetonius describes Caesar when a youth as tall, slight, and hand-
some, with dark piercing eyeS‚ a sallow complexim, large nose‚ lips
full, features refined and intellectual, neck sinewy and thick. He
adds further that he was neat to effeminacy about his dress and
appearance. Fond of athleties, he excelled in all manly sportS‚
especially in riding. In danger he knew no fear and often per-
formed acts of great personal daring. His health was vigorous until
his later yearS, and he could endure an apparently unlimited amount
of labor and hardship. Added years gave him a majestic and com-
manding presence without detracting from the grace and courtesy
of his bearing. We judge him to have been a man of singular charm
and of unusual personal magnetism.

Thanks to the peculiar skill possessed by the ancients in the art
of portraiture, we have good reason to believe that we may see the
great dictator as he waS, from existing statues and bustS. Two of
the most noted of these are the busts in the British Museum (Fig.
47) and that in the Louvre (Fig. 1). The one in the Naples Museum
(F ig. 78) is judged by competent critics to be conventional and not
modelled after the living man. Those first mentioned are thought to
be true to life. The one in the British Museum shows us Caesar the
statesman, the man of peace 3 the one in the Louvre‚ Caesar the man
of action, the martial ὶιειό.2

Cisalpine Gaul. ·

186 3 Clodi: see note above. —ut . . . coniurarent (clause depending
on senatus consult0): this was not an ordinary conscriptiou, but a levy in
mass, in which the entire population of Italy of military age took the oath.
In addition, Caesar orders a levy throughout his own province, in which
were included Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Transalpina, and Illyricum.

186 7 quod videbatur: it naturally seemed to them impossible for
Caesar to quit Italy at this crisis (urbano motu).

186 9, qui dolerent: trans. by preS. part., being indignant, etc.; the
characteristic suij. constantly has this meaning: cf, the use of cum. It
approaches a causal relation, but has properly no notion of cause. —ante:
adV. modifying dolerent.

186 11 principes Galliae: subj. of queruntur.—locis: loc. abl„
without a prep„ as usual.

186 13 Acconis: see Bk. vi. ch. 44.

tur: as the exchange of hostages would be a conspicuous and public act.

187 13 conlatis, etc.: an armed or symbolically armed council seems
to have been the most binding form of public ratification of concerted
measures. Here the standards were gathered in a sheaf and the oath was

taken by this symbol of unity.
187 15 deserantur: it seems to have needed the most solemn forms

of agreement to bind the discordant and jealous Gauls.
187 19 CHAP. 3. Cenabum: now Orleans, on the Loire.

270 Notes .· Coesar. [Β. G.

10 10 eos impeditos, etc.: the emphasis gives a force like “while these
were hampered and not expecting, he engaged them‚” ete. In Latin the
two sentences are made into one; such telescoping of two cotirdinate ideas
is almost regular in Latin.

10 11 concidit: see Vocab. — mandarunt == mandaverunt: ς 181. a
(128. a); B. 116. 1; G. 1313 H. 238 (235); H-B. 163.

10 12 pagus: this ‘⁴ district ’' (Dgurz'nus) was about the modern Zu-
rich. The inhabitants of the pagus probably composed a clan, and formed
a division of the force.

10 15 L. Cassium: see ⁷ 1, 2.
10 17 deorum: this reference to a special providence is noticeable in so

’ stern a realist as Caesar, and was possibly for political effect. Yet he often

speaks of fortune as powerful in human affairs (cf. Bk. vi. ch. 42), and men·
tions divine omens which accompanied 1115 victory over Pompey (Bell. Civ.
111. 105). A disbeliever in the superstitious of his day, he yet seems to
acknowledge the presence of a controlling power. —quae pars . . . intulerat
. . . ea . . . persolvit, render that part which, etc.: see ᾗ 307. b. Ν. (200. b.
N.); cf. B. 251. 4; G. 620; H. 399. 5 (445. 9); H-B. 284. 6.

10 19 princeps poenas persolvit, was tlzefirst to pay tlte penalty: ς 290
(191); B. 239; H. 497. 3 (442. N.); H-B. 243; referring to the complete
overthrow of the rest later. Punishment was regarded among the ancientS,
not as suffering to be inflicted, but as of the nature of a fine or penalty to
be paid ,· hence sumere, capere, to inflict, and dare or solvere, to suffir.

In 1862 numerous remains buried in two trenches were discovered near
this spot, possibly of those slain in this battle.

11 1 iniurias, wrongs, not simply damage, as the word came to mean
afterwards. From Caesar's point of view, an offensive war against Rome
is necessarily wrong.

11 2 soceri: L. Calpurnius Piso, father of Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia
(Shakespeare’s Calpurnia), and consul of the present year (see end of
ch. 6). —legatum: notice how carefully titles are given, a matter of mili-
tary and social etiquette; cf. consulem, 10 15.

11 4 CHAP. 13. reliquas: the emphasis on this word displaces the
connective ut, which would naturally stand first in its clause.

11 5 consequi, overtake (hence the frequent meaning acquz're).—pon-
tem . . . faciendum curat, lzas a bridge made: ξ 500. 4 (294. d) ; B. 337. 7.
b. 2; G. 43o; H. 622 (544. 2. N.2); H-B. 612. iii. —pontemz see chapter on
military affairs, v1.

11 7 cum . . . intellegerent: ς 546 (323, 325); B. 288. 1. 1³3 G. 585;
H. 600. ii. 1 (521. 11. 2); Η-Β. 525; cf. notes on 412, 614, 717. Here
cum may be translated when, but the clause gives the state of mind of the

DIRECTIONS FOR READING.

As “Caesar‚'’ though in many respects a book for advanced stu-·
dentS‚ is often the first Latin classic put ⁴into the learner's handS, it

may be well to give a few hints as to the method of study.

1. Before beginning to read, the learner should be familiar with
the forms of Inflection‚ the simpler rules of Agreement and Con-
struction of Cases and MoodS, the use of TenseS‚ and the Definitions
of common grammatical terms such as Sentence, Subject‚ Predicate,
Object, Transitive and Intransitive‚ Phrase, Clause, and the like.

2. Notice at once the inflectional terminations‚ so that the num·
ber, case, tense, person, etc.‚—which show the corresponding rela-
ftions of the words and ideas to each other, — may be present to your
mind. If the form of the word gives several possibilitieS, hold them
all in your mind, so far as may be, till something occurs in the
progress of the sentence to settle the doubt.

3. Always try to take in the ideas in that order in which the
Latin presents them. Read every word as if it were the last on a
page and you had to turn over without being able to turn back.
The mind soon becomes accustomed to the order of any language‚
as we see by the constant and almost unnoticed inversions of com-
mon speech and poetry. If, however, you are obliged to turn back,
begin again at the beginning of the sentence and proceed as before.
The greatest difficulty to a beginner is his inability to remember the
first parts of a complex idea. This difficulty can often be lessened
by jotting down, in a loose kind of English, the words as they come
in the Latin. In this way it is often easy to see what a string of
words must mean, though we should never say anything like it in
English.

4. Don't try to translate formally until you have got a com-
plete idea of some integral part of the sentence. It makes nonsense

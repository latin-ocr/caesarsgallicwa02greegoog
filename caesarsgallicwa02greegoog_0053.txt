(cf. Bk. v. 18). Sometimes a line of cavalry was sent across the
stream to break the force of the current (cf. Bk. vii. 56). Bridges
were usually very simple affairs of logs covered with earth and brush,
or of boatS‚ but Caesar's masterpiece of military engineering was his
roadway forty feet wide with which he twice spanned the Rhine
(Bk. iv. 17 3 Bk. vi. 9 ; see F igS. 59, 80). ’

VII. THE BATTLE.

As has been said (V), the camp was so chosen that the ground in
front of it would be suitable for battle. The usual order of battle

was triplex acies. The first line of the legion was formed of four Α

cohorts and each of the others of three. In each cohort the three
maniples stood side by side, and in each maniple the two centuries
stood one behind the other, varying in formation according to the
depth of the line. As to the distance between the lines we have no
definite information 3 nor even as to whether spaces were left between
the cohortS. There were probably spaces between the different legions
and doubtless between the centre (media acies), where the legionaries
stood, and the wings (cornua), composed of.auxiliaries and cavalry.
Caesar's lines were probably eight men deep. That would give each
legion, estimated at 3600 men, a front of 180 legionarieS, 45 for
each cohort. When standing in open order for fighting, giving to
each man the space necessary for the free use of his weaponS‚ the
front of each legion covered probably about 1000 feet, supposing the
cohorts to stand close together3 all this, however, is very uncertain.
When an attacking enemy had reached the right distance, the
bugle sounded the charge, and the legions rushed forward‚ sword in
sheath‚ and the front ranks with spears uplifted ready to hurl. When
within range, the spears were thrown in a shower‚ the swords drawn,
and a fierce charge made upon the mass of the foe, more or less
disordered by the volley of spears, Along the front of the cohort
rages a series of combats. The rear ranks press forward, throw
their spears over the heads of their comradeS, and take their places
as the latter are wounded or weary. When the first line of cohorts
has done its best, it makes room for the second line, re-formS, and
gets breath for a new onset.- Thus the battle goes on with the two

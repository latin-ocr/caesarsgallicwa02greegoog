1. 2 5—27.] Tlce Helvetian War. 28 5

answering a question why the fight continued thus, Caesar gives a descrip-
, tion of the situation with pluperfect and imperfects. “ The Gauls had made
a rampart of their carts and from this they kept disclzargy'ng missiles and
using other means of defence.'’ Then the narrative is resumed in the
clause with potiti sunt: cf. note on 3 5.—captus est: observe that the
agreement is with the nearer subject; §317. c (205. d); B. 255. 2; G. 285. 1 ;
H. 392 (463. 1); H-B. 329. 2.

2410 Lingonum: i.e. the southern part of Champagne, towards the
north; see map of Gaul, Fig. 2. The chief town of that region, now
Langres, is about ninety miles from Mont Beuvray. It is very likely, how-
ever, that they reached the Lingones farther west. Napoleon 111 puts the
end of their flight at Tonnerre, sixty miles west of Langres.

24 11 propter, ete. : gives the reason of morati. —cum . . . potuissent:
here the description of the situation (see notes on 6 14, 7 17, 11 7) is so clearly
the cause of the main action that we may translate cum since and refer the
suij. to cum causal (cf. cum praestarent, 2 153 cum inflexisset, 22 s).

2413 Lingonas: Greek form of the acc. common in these names of
tribes: ς 81, 82 (63.f, 64); B. 47. 3: G. 66. 4; H. 109. 5 (68); cf. H-B. 95.

24 14 qui si iuvissent. sor is they should, etc.; the direct would be si
iuveritis. —se, etc. =se (Lingonas) eodem loco habiturum (esse) quo Helve-
tios (haberet).

24 20 CHAP. 27. eos: ie. Helvetios.

24 21 essent: suij. of integral part or attraction3 ξ 593 (342); Β. 3241:
G. 6293 H. 652 (529. ii); H-B. 539. — iussisset: i.e. Caesar: this change of
subject, th‘ough unusual in Latin, is justified by the mention of eum in l. 18.

24 22 qui . . . perfugissent: i.e. fugitive slaves. Caesar in his demand
would say qui perfitgerunt‚ but the suij. is used in the indir. form:
§ 592. 2 (341. c); B. 323: G. 663. 2; 11649. 1 (528. 1); 11—13. 535. 1. a.

24 24 conquiruntur, conferuntur: to express the pass. it is often better
in English to use the act. form, while they were leunting tltese up, ete. ; the
present tense is regular with dum; ἓ 556 (276. c); B. 293. 1; G. 229. R.;
H· 533- 4 (467· 4); H·13. 559ο

24 25 Verbigenus: from the parts between Berne and Lucerne.

24 26 perterriti: agreeing with the persons referred to in milia.—ne
armis, etc.: i.e. either in sheer desperation or in the hope of escape.
Note that after verbs of fearing ne is translated by that or lest.

25 2 occultari, be hid from Caesar3 ignorari, unknown to anybody.

25 3 existimarent: the supposed reason of the Helvetii, hence the
suij.; g 540 (32ῐ); Β. 286. 13 G. 5413 H. 588. ii (516. ii); H-B. 535. 2.
ας cf. 20 12 and note.

25 4 contenderunt ad, made (rapidly) sor.

xxx Introduction.

The subdivisions of the legions were as follows:

1 legion = ιο cohorts of about 360 men each.
1 cohort = 3 maniples of 120 men each.
1 maniple = 2 centuries of 60 men each.

There were, therefore, 10 cohortS, 30 manipleS, and 60 centuries in
each legion. These divisions did not, however, like our companieS,
have special “commissioned officerS,” but were commanded by centu-

· rions who came from the rankS. The legions constituted the main

body of the army and did most of the fighting, but there were other
arms employed for various purposes (see below). The legions were
designated by numbers, given in the order of their enlistment.

2. The Cavalry.

The cavalry (equitatus), originally of Roman citizenS, was in
Caesar's time composed almost exclusively of recruits from subject or
allied stateS. In Caesar's army it was composed of Gauls, Spaniards,
and GermanS. There was no fixed ratio between the number of
legionaries and cavalry. In the campaign against the HelvetianS,
Caesar had 4000 equites, in the battle of Pharsalia, 10003 but the
number of legions was the same in both.

The cavalry was divided into regiments (alae) of about 330 horse-
men each3 these were subdivided into 10 squadrons (turmae) of
33 horsemen each3 and these again into 3 squads (decuriae) of 11
each. See Figs. 12, 13.

3. The Auxiliaries.

The auxiliaries (auxilia peditum) were infantry forces from allied
and subject states. Caesar nowhere gives the number of his auxilia,
and it was doubtless as various as that of his cavalry. They were the
light-armed soldiers (milites levis armaturae), the archers (sagit-
tarii), and the slingers (funditores). See Figs. 30, 104, 105, 115.
The best slingers came from the Balearic Islands, the best archers
from Crete and Numidia. The light-armed soldiers wore no heavy
armor and carried a light round shield (parma). The archers had
neither corselet, helmet, nor shield. The latter they could not carry
on account of their bows.

142 8 aquilam: he thus·saved the standard from disgrace,—a ehar-
acteristic and truly heroic act.

142 11 se interficiunt: a death worthy of Roman soldiers.

This was the most serious loss that Caesar sustained during the Gallie
War. There must have been at least 5000 men in the ill-fated command of
Cotta and SabinuS. From this time on Caesar makes it his duty to avenge
his massacred legion, and he carries on a relentless warfare against the
Eburones and Ambiorix, until the former are exterminated and the latter
becomes a hunted fugitive.

143 13 CHAP. 40. pertulissent: for the fut. perf. implied indir. disc.

144 2 turres: these were open at the sides and behind, solidly
timbered towards the enemy, and their object waS, like that of the modern
bastion‚ to shorten the length of wall to be occupied by the defence as
well as to give the soldiers a still higher position from which to throw
their missiles. In this case they were probably not more than three storieS,
or perhaps thirty feet, high. Each story was floored with a platform on
which the soldiers stood. The front and sides of each platform were pro·
tected by a parapet (loricae) of hurdles, to the height of about four feet.
Above this projected a sort of battlement of stakes (pinnae), or of hurdles
standing creet, with spaces at intervaIS, through which the spears were
hurled. The structure was square, of about ten feet on a side. Of these
towers it appears that on the first night only the framework was erected.

On succeeding nights they were completed. . Cf. Fig. 103.

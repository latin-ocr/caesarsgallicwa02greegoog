the latter, the besiegers had to cover all exposed woodwork with
green hides. Battering rams and mural hooks were caught in
slings and held fast, or drawn into the city, and mines were met by
countermineS. See F igS. 92, 93, ¹27·

When the location of the place was such that it could not be taken
by such a siege as that described above, it was invested on every
side (obsidio) and the inhabitants starved into submission. Among
sieges of this kind were those of Gergovia (Bk. vii. 44-53) and
Alesia (Bk. vii. 72-80)‚ of which the last was one of the most
remarkable ot ancient times; see F igs. 97, 102.

IX. THE FLEET.

Caesar mentions two principal classes of ships: naves longae, or
war galleyS, and naves onerariae, or freight and transport vessels
As compared with the former, the latter were shorter, broader, and
deeper 3 hence could carry greater burdens and were more seaworthy.
They depended mainly on their saiIS, but often had rowers in addi·
tion. The naves actuariae of Bk. v. 1 were a special class of
transport vessel, with both sails and oarS. Caesar used them to carry
troopS, horseS, and munitions of war to Britain. See F igS. 48,
5¹⁷ 52·

The war galley was long, low, and narrow3 armed at the prow
with a sharp bearn (rostrum) shod with bronze, for ramming' the
enemy’s ships ; and propelled by one or two sails and a large force
ot rowerS. The seamen (nautae) attended to the steering and the
managing of the saiIS, and were freemen. The rowers (rengres)
were usually slaveS. Galleys in Caesar's time mostly had three
banks of oarS. The steering apparatus was two broad-bladed oars
near the stern, one on each side. The speed of these vessels was
remarkable, almost equalling that of a modern steamship.

The fighting men were the legionaries embarked for the purpose.
In fact, there was no distinct naval service, as with us. A fleet was
simply an army afloat, and was commanded by military officerS.
Before going into action tormenta were placed on the deck, and also
a turris,· the mast was taken down and the sails and tackle housed.

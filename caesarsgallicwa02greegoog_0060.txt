xlviii Introduction.

flourishing citieS‚ enjoyed prosperous and on the whole peaceful com-
munity life, and practised the arts and commerce. But those farther
removed in the east and north, and the BritonS, were still in a semi-
savage condition. Caesar's expeditions among these are somewhat
like similar military expeditioris that nations are sending in our day
to explore and subdue unknown Africa3 and the trading posts
established among them by the enterprising Greek merchants of
Massilia, like the business ventures formerly sent among the
IndianS.

b. Character and Customs.-—- The Gauls are described as tall and
of great physical strength, with a fair skin and blonde hair, which
they often reddened by artificial means. Men of rank and of author-
ity wore the hair and beard long. The more barbarous tribes gave
themselves a terrible aspect by painting hideous devices on their half-

and their language obscure and figurative. Disparaging otherS‚
boastful of themselveS, arrogant, fond of idleneSS, they were very
quarrelsome and always ready to fight, to relieve the monotony of
their existence, if for no other reason. They were, however, high-

The Gauls lacked stability of character, and are often criticized by
Caesar for their fickleness 3 they were also very avaricious and given

naturally of a simple and teachable disposition. They were very

quick to learn and adopt whatever useful arts their neighbors brought ,

to them. Their love of freedom was passionate3 but their long years
of wandering had not developed in them that feeling of national
unity and that love of the soil that we include under the term
patriotism.

The life of the less civilized tribes was rude in the extreme. Their
houses were little more than huts of clay and wood, thatched with
straw and brancheS. The dwelling was open to daylight by the door

xxxiv Introduction.

the first centurion of the whole cohort (primus or primi-pilus) and
so of the whole legion, must needs be a man oi great personal prowess
and skill, an actual fighter, one to whom all could look as to a model
soldier. Such waS, for example, Publius Sextius BaculuS, who
repeatedly deserved the praise of his general (cf. Bk. ii. 25 3 iii. 5 ;
vi. 38), and Titus Balventius (vir fortz's et magnae virtutis, Bk. v.
35). As a badge of his office the centurion carried a short staff
(vitis), but he was armed much like the other soldiers (see
F ig. 40).

The chief distinction in dress between the officers and men was
the red tunica militaris worn by the legates and tribuneS, and the
purple cloak (paludamentum) worn by the general (Bk. vii. 88).
The officers wore also coats-of-mail of gilded bronze (see F ig. 86).

Between the centurions and common soldiers in rank were the .

speculatores, evocati, beneficiarii, aquiliferi or signifi’ri, and bucina-
tores, tubicines, or cornicines, The speculatores or scouts obtained
news of the enemy and carried despatcheS. The evocati were veterans
who had completed their term of service, but remained in the army at
the request of their commander. The beneficiarii were soldiers that
had received some gift or privilege for meritorious service. The
signiferi or aquiliferi were the standard bearers: soldiers selected
for their courage and fidelity. The bucinatores and tubicines were
the musicians. All of these had rights and exemptions not‘enjoyed
by the common soldiers, See F igS. 39, 84, 1 14.

II. THE STANDARDS.

The term signa is applied in a general sense to all the standards
of the army. That of the legion was an eagle (aquila), usually of
silver or bronze, about the size of a dove, on a wooden staff. It
was sometimes carried by the chief centurion (primipilus) of the
legion. Sometimes it had below it a little red or white banner
(vexillum), inscribed with the number or name oi the legion. See
Figs. 13, 121, 123.

In a narrower sense, signum was used for the standard of the cohort
or the maniple. Each cohort had its own signum (Bk. ii. 21), and
in earlier times each maniple, but probably not in Caesar's day. ⁴

the armed (enemy). —0ccurrerent: result, like redintegrarent.

' The battle with the Nervii and their allies was the most desperate of
the Gallie War. Their surprise of the Romans was complete, their courage
such as to evoke Caesar’s wonder and admiration. Had the Romans come
up in the order of march expected,—a legion at a time with intervening
baggage, —they could hardly have escaped defeat or even annihilation.
As it was, only the steadiness and discipline of the troops and the inspira-
tion of Cae‘sar's presence and example at a critical moment saved the day.

68 18 CHAP. 28. prope ad internecionem: the Nervii were not by any
means exterminated. Three years later they revolted again (Bk. v. ch. 38),

Vercingetorix (Bk. vii. ch. 7 5).

xlvi Introduction.

of such excuses there was usually no lack. The Roman policy was
to enter into friendly relations with one of the parties or tribes in the
free territory, load this with favors and privilegeS, and make use of
it to overcome its rivals3 in Gaul the Haedui, attached to Rome
through some local rivalries, very well served this purpose.

Caesar’s province, at its western extremity, reached to Spain, a
country which had belonged to the empire for more than a hundred
and fifty yearS. To the north lay four great nationalitieS, with all of
which he was ultimately brought in contact. These were the Gauls
proper, the BelgianS, the Germans‚ and the Britons.

F ree‘ Gaul (Libera Gallia) at that time consisted of all the un-
subdued territory between the Pyrenees and the ocean on the one
side, and the Rhine and the Alps on the other, thus comprising, in
general, modern F rance and Belgium, with parts of Holland, Ger-
many, and Switzerland. The central portion of this territory, fully a
half of it in extent and population, was occupied by the Gauls proper,
or, as they called themselveS, Celts, no doubt originally the same
word. Southwest of these were the Aquitani, a separate people
of Iberian race, cognate to the Spanish3 of these, the Basques of
the present day are the representative& To the northeast lived the
BelgianS, whose ethnic affinities are much disputed3 all that can be
considered certain is that they were largely mixed with GermanS.
The Belgians occupied more territory than is now known as Belgi—um,
including a considerable part of Holland on the one hand, and the
northern belt of F rance on the other.

2. THE GALL1c PEOPLE.

a. Orzssgin and Early History. — The Gauls were a branch of the
great nations of the Indo-European family that in prehistoric times
occupied parts of Asia and the greater part of Europe. They were
known to the ancients as Celts or GauIS, and this name was applied
without discrimination to all the barbarous peoples of the unknown
west of Europe. The term was rather geographical than racial. The
RomanS, though they had been brought into contact with the bar-
barians of the north by war and commerce for many centurieS, made
no distinction, before Caesar’s time, between German and Gaul.

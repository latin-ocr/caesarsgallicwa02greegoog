2 50 Notes .· Coesar. [Β. G.

PAGE 1. LINE 1. Gallia: that is, Transalpine Gaul, excluding the
Roman province (Provincia) in the southeast‚ as well as Gallia Cisalpina,
now northern Italy. It occupied the territory of F rance, including the
country to the Rhine boundary, with most of the Netherlands and Switzer·
land (see map, F ig. 2).—omnis (predicate), as a ‘cohelet—est divisa, is
divide-d .· the adjective use of the participle, not the perfect passive; ς 495
(291. b); B. 337. ες G. 250. R.2; H. 640. 3 (550. N.2); H-B. 320. iii.—
unam: sc. partem.

1 2 incolunt: in translation (not in reading the Latin to make out the
sense) change the voice to the passive in order to preserve the empha-
sis in the English idiom. Itis well to acquire the habit of making such
changes. The natural English form would be: qs wlziclz one is inhabited by
tlte Belgians, etc.‚ but the Latin uses the active voice. The moment you
find an accusative beginning a sentence, if it seems from its meaning to be
a direct object, you can at once think of it as a subject in the nominative
(at tlte same time noticing that tlze Latin does not make it such). The verb can
then be instantly thought of as a passive and the subject as agent. This
inversion is so common in Latin for purposes of rhetoric that such a device
is a very helpful one, and if properly used from the start need not obscure
the Latin construction. The Latin plays upon the position' of words to pro-
duce all sorts of shades of rhetorical expression, and it is never too early
to observe these shades and try to render thern in our own idiom. --
Belgae: probably of the Cymric branch of the Celtic race, allied to the
Britons and the modern Welsh; they inhabited the modern Belgium and
northern France, and were considerably mixed with Germans (see Bk. ii.
ch. 1). —Aquitaniz of the Spanish Iberians (the modern Basques) inhabit-
ing the districts of the southwest (see Bk. iii. ch. 20).——aliam: here alteram
would be more usual as meaning the second in the list.— qui . . . appel-
lantur: notice that in Latin any relative may suggest its own antecedent,
as with the indefinite relative (whoever) in English. In English we have to
supply a demonstrative (those) who, So here tertiam qui = tertiam partem

H-B. 284. 1.—ipsorum‚ etc: notice that the position of words is so sig-
nificant in Latin, through its indicated emphasis, that it may allow words

to be omitted which must be supplied in the thought. In this case the
English idiom is the same: in their own tongue . . . in ours.

1 3 celtae: probably of the Gaelic branch, represented by the Irish and
the Highland Scotch. —linguat abl. of specification; ᾗ 418 (253); B. 226;

proper, Celtic; of the Belgians, another dialectos Celtic mixed with German.

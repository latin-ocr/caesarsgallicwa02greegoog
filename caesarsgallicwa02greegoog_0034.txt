resolved to prevent this, and commanded him to resign his office and
disband his army several months before the expiration of his term.
If they could once get him to Rome as a private citizen without an
army, they knew they could crush him. Caesar knew this t00‚ and
refused to obey the decree unless Pompey should also disband his
troopS. Pompey would bave been willing to agree to this fair propo·
sition, but his friends would not permit him, and were bent on
destroying Caesar. N aturally the charge of false play was made
on both sideS‚ and the strife continued until Caesar was finally
declared a public enemy. He therefore crossed the Rubicon, a
small stream which formed the boundary of his province and the
limit of his authority, and began to march towards Rome. He took
but a single legion with him and continued his efforts to come to an
understanding with the Optimam, having hopes of a compromise.
He made a speech to his soldierS, explaining the situation, and was
assured of their enthusiastic support. Labienus alone deserted him,
corrupted, it is said, by Roman gold.

Caesar’s march through Italy was like a triumphal procession 3 the
cities opened their gates to him and he was everywhere hailed with
enthusiasm. Among the Optimates there was nothing but conster-
nation and fear. They had pinned their faith to Pompey, who had
boasted that he had but to stamp his foot on the ground and legions
would spring from the earth ready to obey him. He had vastly over-
rated himself (as was his wont), and had no conception of Caesar’s
power and genius, Cicero well sums up the situation in a letter to
his friend Atticus : “The consuls are helpless. There has been no
levy. With Caesar pressing forward and our general doing nothing,
the men will not come to be enrolled. Pompey is prostrate, without
courage, without purpose, without force, without energy.” Pompey
had been looked upon by his partisans as almost divine. He had
been peculiarly fortunate throughout his career ancl had made a great
military reputation by assuming the laurels that others had won.
Mommsen says of him: “He was radically a commonplace man,
formed by nature to make a good corporal, but forced by circum-
stances to be a general.” Now that he was confronted by a really
serious difficulty and by a really able man, he was paralyzed.

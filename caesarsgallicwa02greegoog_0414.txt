· 7 10 CHAP. 8. ea legione, with that legion (abl. of instrum.). In this
sentence observe how all the qualifying clauses come first and the direct
objectS‚ murum, fossam, come next before the leading verb perducit3

each relative belongs to the verb which comes next aster it unless another
relative intervenes, — a very convenient rule in analyzing a long and difficult
sentence.

G. 335; H. 417 (379); H-B. 387.—decem novem, nineteen: following the
windings of the river (see note on 5 8).—murum: this rampart, or earth·
work, was on the south side of the river, leaving the passage undisputed
along the northern bank.

The banks of the Rhone in this part are generally rugged and steep,
with sharp ravines3 there are only five short reaches—a little over three
miles in all—requiring defences. The current is in general quite rapid.
Some remains of Caesar⁹s works can still be traced‚ according to the F rench
engineers who surveyed the ground under the orders of Napoleon ΙΙΙ.
According to Caesar's statement the work was continuous (this is the
meaning of perducit). This undoubtedly means that, after the five acces·
sible points were strengthened by artificial defenceS, the entire left bank of
the Rhone, from Geneva to Pas-de-l'Ecluse (17½ English miles), formed a
continuous barrier against the Helvetians. The construction of any one
of the fortifications may be described as follows: Along the erest of the
ridge facing the river the slope was cut so as to be vertical, or nearly so,
and then a trench was hollowed. The earth dug out was partly thrown up
to increase the height of the wall, and quite likely in part thrown down the
. hill. At all events, it seems probable that the measure of 16 feet is the dis-
tance from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the wall. Thus the work
formed really little more than a trench with scarp higher than the counter-
scarp. Then the erest was fortified with a breastwork of palisades, behind
which the soldiers were protected while hurling their missiles at the enemy.
This entire series of workS‚ with the force at Caesar's command, could not
have occupied more than two or three days, See Map, p. 5.

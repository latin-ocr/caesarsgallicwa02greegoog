begin either the first or second book 'and avoid at the start the
enormous difficulties of the indirect form. They have endeav-
ored to put in every kind of illustration that might tend to
make the story more real to the pupil’s imagination.

In order to encourage pupils to associate words together for
acquiring a vocabulary they have made a large number of
groups of words containing the same elements without intro-
ducing the vague notion of rootS. It is hoped that these may
be found convenient to learn by heart, at least in some measure.
Attention is also called to the foot-notes which have been added
to the text. In the first‘four books these refer backward to
some previous use of the same word. In the last three books
reference is made to words of similar or opposite meaning,
whereby it is thought that sight-readin g may be facilitated. The
editors have not thought it desirable to give any pronouncing
vocabulary of proper name8‚ as generally these may be pro-
nounced in the Latin manner, except those few that are familiar
enough to have become English words, like Caesar and Cicero,
which of course must be pronounced like' English. The vocab-
ulary has been enriched by a fuller insertion of idioms‚ and the
etymological’matter has been made clearer without sacrificing

its peculiar character.

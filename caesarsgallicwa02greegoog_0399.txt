Boox FIRST.—-B.C. 58.

THE ΗεινετιΑΝ WAR.—Early in the year 58 ΒΕ. the whole population of
Helvetia (northern Switzerland), amounting to about 360,ooo, attempted to pass by
an armed emigration through the beart of Gaul, in order to settle somewhere near
the shore of the Bay of Biscay, possibly with the hope of becomin g masters of the whole
country. They were hemmed in by the great natural barriers of the Alps, the Lake
of Geneva‚ and the Jura Mountains on the south and west, and pressed on the
north by great bordes of Germans, who kept up a continual border war. Their fields
were scant, their harvests insufficient, their people hardy and fearless. Their ambi·
tious chief, Orgetorix, had prepared them so well for this enterprise that his ssight
and death—when he was charged with guilty conspiracy and put on trial for his
life—caused no delay. The attempt was held in check by Caesar, during a fort-
night’s parley, till sufficient earthworks had been thrown up along the Rhone to
withstand their advance across the river; the advance was then made in force along
the nari-ow pass between that river and the Jura. But the Helvetians did not suc-
‹zeed in getting more than fifty miles beyond the frontier when they were overtaken
by Caesar, who, by a few light skirmishes and two bloody battles, forced them back
to their own territories with the loss of more than 200,000 lives. This brief cam-
paign, lasting only from March to June, is called the Helvetian War.

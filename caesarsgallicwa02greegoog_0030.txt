xviii Introduction.

In B.C. 63 he was elected pontt-‘fex maximus against the strong
opposition of the optimates. This office was one of great political
power and dignity, though not formally a civil office. Caesar held it
for the rest of his life. In 62 he was elected praetor, an office of a
judicial character, and this was followed by a year of command in
Spain as propraetor. Before leaving for Spain, his creditors became
insistent and threatened to detain him unless he paid them. Caesar
then obtained a large loan from the richest man in Rome, CrassuS,
who was ambitious for office and doubtless hoped to make good use
in turn of Caesar's brilliant abilities to further his own endS.

In Spain Caesar gained valuable military experience and made his
administration so profitable to himself, as was usual with provincial
governors, that, though he left Rome owing millions of sesterceS, he
returned in the year 60 with enough money to pay all his deth. His
design was to run for the consulship, the highest office in the gift of
the people. To secure his election he effected a union of interests
between himself and Crassus and Pompey. These were the two
most powerful men in Rome, — Crassus because of his wealth, Pom-
pey because of his fame as a general and his popularity with the
army. The latter waS‚ in fact, really the first man in the state. He
had but recently returned from Asia Minor laden with the spoils
of the Mithridatic war, and might easily have seized the dictatorship
had he so chosen 3 but he disbanded his army and preferred to appear
as a private citizen, but with almost autocratic power. He had quar-
reled with CrassuS, but Caesar reconciled them, and the three formed
a sort of offensive and defensive alliance known as the first trium·
virate, —what we should call a political deal. This was for Caesar,
who was at that time quite their inferior in fame and influence, a
master stroke of craft and diplomacy.

In 59 Caesar was elected consul almost without opposition. He
well understood the critical condition of affairs and saw clearly the
dangers that threatened the state, and instituted valuable reforms
looking to its regeneration and salvation. The army and the moneyed
classes represented by Pompey and Crassus were with him, and he
could do almost as he pleased. His first act was the passage of an
agrarian law, by which thousands of acres were to be distributed
to ’the poor. This was not a mere act of bribery, but an attempt to

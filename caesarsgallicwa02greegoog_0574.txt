“ Brave as they were, the Roman soldiers seem to have been curiously liable
to panics of this kind. The faith with which they relied upon their general
avenged itself through the completeness with which they were accustomed
to depend upon him. He returned on the day which he had fixed‚ and
not unnaturally was displeased at the disregard of his orders. He did not,
or does not in his Commentaries, professedly blame Cicero. But the
Ciceros perhaps resented the loss of confidence which one of them had
brought upon himself. Quintus Cicero cooled in his zeal, and afterwards
amused the leisure of his winter quarters with composing worthless
,dramas.” -— froude’s ‘⁶ Caesar.”

lii Introduction.

The strange monuments of stone found in many lands‚ called
‘cromlechs' and ⁴ menhir5,’ popularly supposed to be Druidic monu-
ments, are far older than the Druids and have nothing to do with

greed. The country was rapidly colonized and civilized. Augustus
divided it into four provinces and established the Roman authority

to this day‚—France, the lands of the Franks. There were many
social and political changes after this time, but the same life flowed
on from Roman Gaul to modern F rance. The F rench still display
many of the characteristics of the ancient Gauls3 they live in sub-
stantially the same limits; many of their mountains, citieS, and
streams still bear'the old names.

WITH Caesar begins the history of England. He found there a
Celtic people, differing but little from those on the continent, save

British Isles was before Caesar's invasion is wrapped in obscurity.
A few Greek writers refer vaguely to them, and there was an equally
vague knowledge of the smaller islands lying near. Even Caesar

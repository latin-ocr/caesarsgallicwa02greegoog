CAMPMGN AGAINST ‘rna Gemmas—The year 13.c. 55 appears to have been
marked by a general movement in the migration of the German tribes. An advance,
consisting of two tribes, the Usipetes and Tencteri, crowded forward by the more
powerful Suevi, crossed the lower Rhine into northern Gaul. Caesar assumed the
defence of the country he had just conquered, drove them back across the Rhine,
followed them up by an expedition into their own territorieS, and fully established
the supremacy of the Roman arms. Another brief campaign in Germany two years
later confirmed this success, and the Rhine became the military frontier, recognized
for many centuries, between the Roman Empire and the barbarian world.

ΒΩ. 55. Observe that the usual way-of fixing a year is by naming the con-
suls for that year. The coalition between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus,
sometimes called the First Triumvirate‚ had been formed five years before.
In carrying out the scheme, Caesar held the government of Gaul, while the
others took into their own hands the whole control of affairs at home (see
Introduction, ‘⁴ Life of Caesar'’).

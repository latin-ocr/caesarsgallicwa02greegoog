simple narrative in persuasit above and constituerunt, etc., below. This

distinction is very marked in Latin, and must always be noticed‚ though
not always translated. Our progressive imperfect is much more limited in
its use than the Latin imperfect. But the latter always describes a situa-

The mood shows that its clause expresses not the writer’s statement, but
that of the speaker or actor or some other person concerned. Always
bear in mind that Caesar uses the subjunctive to express something differ-
ent from the indicative, whether you can find the technical rule for it or

by a subjunctive clause with ut,· §457 (271. a); B. 328. 1; G. 423; 1-1.

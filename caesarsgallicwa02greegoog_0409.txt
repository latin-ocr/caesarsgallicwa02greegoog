pose clause.

412 cum . . . conaretur, when tlze state attempted. The force of the
suij. here cannot easily be made apparent in translation, and may be
disregarded as too subtle for this stage of the pupil’s advancement. It is
perfectly manifest, however, and can be learned later; ξ 546 (323); B. 288.
1. 133 G. 5853 H. 600, ii. 1 (521. ii. 2); H-B. 524.

4 17 ut . . . exeant, in apposition with id: as we should say, “namely‚
to go forth.'’ Clauses thus used in apposition with a noun or pronoun
take the form required by the verb on which the appositional word
depends. Here facere would take a result clause with ut, and so this
clause has that form. —ubi . . . arbitrati sunt, when they judged .· observe
the regular use of the perfect indic. with ubi, postquam, etc., and cf. cum
. . . conaretur above; ς 543 (324); B. 287. 13 G. 5613 H. 602 (518. N.¹);

4 23 molita cibaria, meal. Food for 368,ooo people (cf. 26 11) for

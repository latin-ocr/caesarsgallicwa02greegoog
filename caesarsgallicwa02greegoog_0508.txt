General von Goler explains the Roman works as follows: “ A dike was
extended along each side of the isthmus in the direction of the town.
While these were building, of course with each rise of the tide the space
within would be overflowed. When the dikes were nearly completed, the
Romans waited until the ebb had carried off the water, and then rapidly
pushed their works to completion before the next turn of the tide. Thus
the sea was shut out and the isthmus left dry. Meanwhile the dikes them-
selveS‚ being raised to the height of the waIIS, each served the purpose of
an agger for approach to the town.'’

66 5 CHAP. 25. Caesar: subject of processit, 67 9. In this charac-
teristic example of Latin style notice that the main verb of the sentence is
not expressed until the attendant circumstances have been introduced in
the form of modifying phrases, dependent clauses, etc. Thus the sense
and construction are suspended. Such a sentence is called a Period .· §600‚
601 (346); B. 351. 53 G. 684, 685. 2; H. 685 (573); H-B. 629, 630. An
English writer would have used several short, independent sentences, each
describing a single act or circumstance ; and a really good translation should
have that form, thus :—

Caesar‚ after addressing the tenth legion, passed to the right wing.
Here he saw his men were hard pressed. The standards were all huddled
together and the soldiers of the twelfth, massed in a solid body, were in
each other's way. All the centurions of the fourth cohort had fallen, the
standard-bearer was killed, and the standard lost. In the other cohorts
almost all the centurions were either killed or wounded. Among these the
first centurion, P. Sextius Baculus, one of the bravest of soldiers, was dis-
abled by many severe wounds so that he could no longer stand on his feet.
The rest were showing no spirit, and some in the rear had abandoned the
fight and were drawing back to get out of range of the missiles. The
enemy meanwhile continued to come up in front from below without cessa-
tion‚ and to press them hard also on both flanks. The situation was des-
perate. Seeing this, and realizing that there were no reserves that could be
sent in, Caesar snatched a shield from a man in the rear rank—it happened
that he had come there without a shield himself — and advanced to the front.

66 6 ubi: construe with vidit, 1. 8. —in unum locum: i.e. the soldiers
were so crowded together that they could not keep their alignment, and
the standards were bunched in a confused mass in the crowd.

66 7 sibi . . . impedimento, hindered one another in fighting (lit. were
sor a hindrance themselves to themselves) 3 cf. 56 4, 62 11.

66 8 quartae cohortis ε this stood on the left of the front line and so
bore the brunt of the attack. See chapter on military affairs», VI and v11.
—omnibus centurionibus occisis: notice that seven different events are
expressed in this sentence by ablatives absolute. See note on omni
pacata Gallia, 49 6.

66 9 signo : i.e. the standard of the cohort.

6⁷ 1 in liis, among these. —primipilo ε see chapter on military affairs,
1. 7. — Baculo: this was one of Caesar’s best centurions. His further
exploits are mentioned in Bk. iii. ch. 5 and Bk. vi. ch. 38.

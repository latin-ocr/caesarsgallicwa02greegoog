13 8 equitibus: abl. of means,

manner or meanS.

13 12 satis habebat, lzeld it sufflant—hostem . . . prohibere: in a
kind of pred. agreement with satis, as object of habebat—rapinis: ξ 400

1313 ita . . . uti, in suclz a way tlzat (correlative).—dies: cf. with
diebus, 11 8, and note the difference between the acc. and the abl. of time.

13 15 quinis aut senis: distributives, implying that this was the con-
stant or average daily distance between the two armies. They apparently
marched along the Saone, in the direction of Chalon. Their exact route
from the Saone towards Autun is uncertain. The country here is very
irregular and broken; so that it was impossible for Caesar to get any
advantage by a rapid march or by an attack on the Helvetian rear. He
consequently followed them, watching his chance. —milibusz ᾖ 406 (247);

13 18 essent polliciti: suij. because of the implied indir. disc., which
(he said) they lead promised. — flagitare: histor. infin.; ἕ 463 (275) ; Β. 33 5;
G. 647; H. 610 (536. 1); H-B. 595. Notice that this construction, like
the imperfect tense, only describes a situation, and never advances the
narrative. The word expresses an earnest and repeated demand accom-
panied with reproaches—frigora, tlze cold seasons, or spells of cold,· not
the cold in general. The climate of Gaul in Caesar's day was much colder
than that of France now. The change has come from clearing away the
forests and draining the marshes, which then covered much of the country.

13 20 frumenta: the plur. is regularly used of standing grain. The
crops of grain were not ripe because it was too early in the season (about
the last of June) ; the green fodder (pabuli) was scarce because Caesar was
following in the path of the Helvetians, whose thousands of cattle had
almost swept the country bare. —- ne . . . quidem, not even: ξ 322.]ῗ (151. e) 3

gathered, it was on the way, it was already at lumd.

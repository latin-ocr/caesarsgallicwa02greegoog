and was a much better weapon. In Caesar’s time the iron sword
probably still predominated. They had also various kinds of pikes,
lances, and javelins, some made with peculiar waving and twisted
blades to cause an uglier wound. Many weapons are mentioned with
special names, but they are not capable of identification. Bows and
slings, τοο, were used by them.

Ordinarily the Gaul wore no defensive armor. In fact, the common
soldier went into battle with body almost bare. But the principal
warriors wore chain mail (see F ig. 86), which is said to be a Gallie
invention. At first this was made of iron. Later, better and lighter
suits were made of bronze, and were sometimes adorned with silver
and gold. The usual means for defence were the helmet and the
shield. Shields were of various shapes and sizes and were adorned with
figures of animaIS, etc., to suit the caprice or wealth of the owner, but
the designs were of ancient origin. The helmets were surmounted
with great horns, forms of birds or beastS, etc„ designed to terrify
the enemy (see F ig. 11). These also were, no doubt, survivals of
earlier barbarism.

In battle they placed much reliance on their cavalry and in N orthern
Gaul and Britain on their war chariots. The infantry was arranged
in great masses of men in close order, like the old Greek phalanx,
with a line of shields before and on the sides, and sometimes with a
roof of shields overhead‚ something like the testudo formation of
the Romans, When they had drawn near, champions were accus-
tomed to leave the ranks, and, brandishing their arms, challenge the
foe to single combat. The first onset of the Gallie phalanx was
terrific and often swept everything before it; but if that could be
withstood‚ the advantage lay with the open and pliable order of the
legion. In the latter every soldier was called into action, but in the
former the great bulk of the Gallie warriors was practically imprisoned
in the masS, and only those on the outside could use their arms.

e. Government. — The Gauls were not a single nation, but a group
of nations or tribes, about sixty in number, united by a very slight
bond of consanguinity and common religion. These tribeS, which
may be loosely compared to those of the North American Indians,
though most of them were at a very much higher degree of civiliza-
tion, varied greatly in extent and power, the smaller ones often main-

Roman Military A ffairS. xxxiii

They had charge of the military chest, and saw to the pay, clothing,
shelter‚ and general equipment of the legions serving in their respec-
tive provinceS. On occasion they exercised the military authority of
a legatus (Bk. i. 53); they were the ancient equivalent of a modern
quartermaster. Besides these general officerS‚ there were attached to
each legion six tribuni militum, who were probably originally in com-
mand of the legion. They were divided into three pairs, each pair
taking command in its turn. In Caesar's time they were no longer
trained soldierS, but chiefly young men of equestrian rank, who went
into the army for a year or two to get some military experience and
thus begin their public career (cf. Bk. i. 39), so that ordinarily the
legion had no proper commanding officerS. Caesar was 'not slow
to see that these political and social favorites were not the men

. to lead his legions into battle, and he therefore introduced the

lasting reform of transferring this duty to the legati, as mentioned
above (cf. Bk. ii. 203 v. 1, 25, 47). Thereafter the duties of the
tribunes became mainly administrative and judicia13 they cared for
the levying, the discharge, and the equipment of the troopS‚ and for
the army supplieS, under the orders of the quaes-tor,- and they pre-
sided at courts-martial and took part in the councils of war. Some·
times they led the legions on the march and received subordinate
military commands (cf. Bk. vii. 47, 52).

Surrofinding the superior officers there was always a large number
of young men, forming a kind of staff, who acted as orderlies and
body-guarda The only officers ‘⁴ of the line'’ were the tribunes, and,
as appears above, their command was limited.

The real leaders of the men were the inferior (⁴⁶ non-commissioned ”)
officerS, the centurions. Corresponding to sergeants and corporaIS,
these were always plebeians, often of the lowest birth, who were
promoted from the ranks entirely on account of their fighting quali-
ties, and could never rise higher. There were two centurions in
each maniple‚ making six for each cohort and sixty for the legion.
The six centurions of the first cohort outranked the others and were
called centuriones primorum ordinum, and were the only ones that
ordinarily sat with the superior officers in the council of war. The
first cohort always contained the flower of the legion, and the men in
the first century of this cohort excelled all the others. Their leader,

2 17 hoc facilius, all tlze easier: originally degree of. difference, as in
all ablatives with comparative; but hardly different in sense from the abl.
of cause; ξ 404 (245); B. 2¹93 G. 408; H. 475 (416); H-B. 424. a.—id:
object of persuasit3 ξ 369 (227.s); B. 176. 2. a; G. 3453 H. 426. 6
(384. 2); H-B. 364. 4: we should say, persuaded them of it. Usually with
persuadere the dat. and acc. are botlz used only when the latter is a pro-
noun. —loci natura, by the nature of tlze country.

2 18 una ex parte, on one side: cf. ab Sequanis above, so undique, on
(lit. from) all sides ‚· hinc, on tlcis side, ete. The effect on the senses is
supposed to come from the direction referred to.—latissim0‚ very broad.

219 qui takes its gender not from flumine, but from Rhen03 §306
(199); B. 250. 3; G. 614. 3. b; H. 396. 2 (445. 4)3 H-B. 326.

2 23 his rebus, etc.: lit. from these things it was coming about that tlzey
roamed about less widely and could less easily make war, etc. But th-is is
obviously not an English mode of thought, nor a form which any English-
speaking person would ever naturally use. So here, as always, you must
see from this clumsy expression what is meant and then express it in the
natural vernacular, something like, from all tlzis tlzey were getting less free
to wonder and leaving less opportunity to make war, etc. Several other
ways of expressing this may be imagined. One of the greatest advantages
of Classical study is to set the mind free from forms, and bring into prom-
inence the possibility of saying the same thing in fundamentally different
ways. —fiebatz the imperfect expresses the continued effect of the causes;
§470 (277); B. 260. 1; G. 2313, H. 534 (468, 469); H-B. 468. 2; the
subject of fiebat is the clause ut . . . possent: ἓ 569 (332. α); Β. 297. 2,
cf. 284.1; G. 553. 3, 4; H. 571. 1 (501. i); H-B. 521. 3. a.

2 24 qua ex parte: here in wlciclz respect hardly differs from from which
causa—homines (a sort of rapposition)·=being (as they were) men eager
for war.

3 1 bellandi: ξ 349. a (218. (²); B. 338. 1. [νς G. 374. 5; H. 626, 451. 1
(542. 1, 399. i. 1); H-B. 612. 1.—adficiebantur=afficiebantur: for the
assimilation of consonants, see ξ 16 (1 1); B. 8. 4; G. 9; Η. 374. 2 (344. 5);
H-B. 51. 2. In this edition the unchanged form of the preposition is
usually preferred. —pro, in proportiove to ,· cf. our force offor.

3 2 multitudine: their numbers, including some small dependent popu·
lations, were 368,000 (see ch. 29).

3 3 angustos finis, too narrow lz'mits. So in English such words often
suggest a negative idea3 cf. a “scant pattern.''

3 4 milia passuum, miles (1000 paces), the regular way of stating this
measure, milia being acc. of extent of space, and passuum part. gen. The
passus was the stretch from heel to heel, i.e. from where one heel is raised

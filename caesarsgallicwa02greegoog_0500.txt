Au’me CAMPAIGN.— The higher valleys of the Alps were inhabited by tribes
who got a scanty living by working in mines, and often waylaid and plundered expe-

had been atmcked by these predatory people while passing into the valley of the
Rhone above Lake Geneva; hence this expedition, sent in the fall οἱ 57, which was
intended to strike terror into the mountain tribes.

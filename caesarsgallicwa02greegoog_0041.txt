1. The Legions.

The Roman legion corresponded to a modern Division‚ but was
more an organic whole, since it was the smallest unit that had sepa-
rate line officerS. What its normal strength was in Caesar's time we
have no means of knowing; but a probable estimate puts it at 5000
men. The actual effective strength in the field, however, was usually
much less, falling to 3000 men, as at the battle of Pharsalia (on
Caesar's own authority). This variation in number was due to the
many absences from duty which always occur in a military organiza-
tion, and to the losses incurred by the individual legions in previous
campaignS. Losses in old legions were not usually made good by
new recruitS‚ but the latter were formed into new legions ; hence the
older the legion, the smaller usually its enrollment. The average
effective strength of the legion in the Gallie War was probably near
3600 men.

The Lg'fe qs Caius Julius Coesar. xix

restore the peasant freeholderS‚ who had been dispossessed by the
rich. Then he passed the excellent body of laws known as the
Leges saliae, which mark an epoch in Roman jurisprudence‚ and
which were devised in the interests of individual rights, purity of
justice, morality‚ and good government. All that one man could do
in a single year to save his country from anarehy, Caesar did.

Caesar was now forty·three years of age. With the exception of
the time spent in Spain, his life had been employed in petty miser-

potent in war—hope, confidence, audacity‚ and pugnacity—are
qualities that belong to youth. , So Caesar is an anomaly in military
history. In spite of his years and his comparative inexperience, he
leaped at once to the highest place, and is counted to-day among
the three or four greatest generals in history, if not the greatest
of them all. He never lost a set battle and he showed infinite versa·
tility in adapting means to endS, always doing the right thing at the

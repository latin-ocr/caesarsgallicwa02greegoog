a commonwealth (civitas), — about 60 in all. Their territory had no local
name, but was known only by that of the elan, which was sovereign and
wholly independent‚ except for voluntary alliances (see ch. 30). The name

Dumnorigi (dat. after persuadet) : Dumnorix, a younger brother, restless,
ambitious, and strongly attached to the old aristocracy of the clan; there-
fore a bitter enemy of the Roman supremacy. He afterwards headed a
desertion of Caesar’s cavalry just before the second invasion of Britain,
but was pursued and killed (Bk. v. ch. 6). It is implied that in the popu-

by the Sequani and Arverni. The Druids were a religious or priestly
order, jealous of the aristocracy (equites) of the tribe or elan, which latter

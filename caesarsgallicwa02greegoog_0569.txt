vl. ²4-30·] Second Passage qs tlte Rlzine. 41 1

173 17 si . . . conciderunt: cf. 172 3 and note. By what tense
should this perfect be rendered? The same construction occurs below
in l. 20, cum est animadversum, and in 1. 23, cum reclinaverunt.

173 21 omnes: with arbores.

173 22 ab radicibus, at the roots. —accidunt,cut inm—tantum ut,
ete.: lit. sofar that tlte perfect appearance of them standing· is lest ,· trans·
late, so that to all appearances they are standing firmly.

173 26 CHAP. 28. uri: this name is generally understood to refer to
the German Urochs (the primitive or wild ox, probably buffalo), said still to
be found in the forests of Lithuania. Caesar evidently describes a very dif-
ferent animal, with spreading horns like those of a reindeer or moose; but
the whole description must have been derived from a confused account.

174 6 quae sint testimonie, to serve as evidence, a purpose clause.

174 7 ne . . . excepti, not even when caught quite young.

174 12 CHAP. 29. Caesar, etc. This chapter directly follows ch. 10
in the narrative, the intervening passage being a digression.

174 14 supra: see 170 26.

174 16 ne . . . tolleret: as would be done by completely destroying
the bridge—barbaris: dat.; ς 381 (229); B. 188. 2. d: G. 345. R.¹; H.
427 (385. ii. 2); H-B. 371.—-atque‚ and at the same time. —ut tardaret:
which he did by making the bridge practically useless.

174 17 auxilia: i.e. which the Germans might send to aid the Gauls,

174 19 in extremo ponte. There seems to have been an island in the
river at this place, so that the bridge was in two sections. The section
between the island and the east bank was destroyed, and at what was now
the end of the bridge (extremo), on the island, the tower was built. There
was probably a redoubt‚ as usual, at the entrance to the bridge on the
mainland; see Fig. 59.

174 20 cohortium ε these were auxiliarieS‚ as it appears in ch. 33 that
he took all his legions with him.

174 23 cum maturescere, etc.: i.e. early in August.

174 24 Arduennam: the modern Ardennes.

174 27 D: an obvious mistake, possibly of some copyist. The dis-
tance is about 150 miles—Basilum: afterwards one of the conspirators
against Caesar.

174 28 si . . . possit, (to see) whether he can, etc.: see ἓ 576. α
(334. f); Β. 300. 3; G. 460. (b); H· 649. 3 (529. ii. 1. N.1); H-B. 582. 2
and a.

175 1 qua: why not quae?

175 2 subsequi: notice the pres. for the fut.

175 7 CHAP. 30. multum potest, has great power ,· see note on 10 17.

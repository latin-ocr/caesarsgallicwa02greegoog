T lze sze of Caius Julius Coesar. xvii

of Greek, rhetoric, grammar, philosophy, and oratory. To be a good
speaker was essential to political succeSS, and Caesar was especially
anxious to excel in that direction. He gave some public exhibitions
of his skill and won much applause; but anxious to perfect himself
still farther he went to Rhodes in 76, to study under Apollonius
Molon, the most famous teacher of oratory and rhetoric of the day.
On this journey, when near Miletus, he was captured by pirates and
held for a heavy ransom. He spent some time among them while
waiting for the money, and joined in their sports and games with the
greatest freedom‚ at the same time assuring them that he would hang
them all as soon as he was free. They seem to have regarded him
with mingled awe and admiration. The ransom was paid. Caesar
was released, went at once to MiletuS, where he hastily collected
a few ships and made a descent on the pirates before they dreamt
of danger. He recovered the ransom money and punished the pirates
as he had threatened.

On his return to Rome, he began his political career (13.c. 68) by
serving as quaestor‚ an office connected with the public treasury and
the first step toward the consulship. This was followed in 65 by the
aedileship. The taking of this office, which was one of the chief
magistracies‚ though it involved only the care of the public buildings
and the oversight of the great festivals and gameS, was considered
a direct bid for a future consulship, and a man's claims upon that
higher office were determined in large measure by the lavishness and
splendor of his aedileship. Caesar was poor, but with characteristic
boldness he played for the highest political stakes and did not hesi-

not the most perfect confidence in his capacity and his powers believed
Ι him irretrievably ruined. His aedileship surpassed all before it in
magnificence;·but he left it—as he remarked with grim humor-
worth more than a million dollars less than nothing.

After his aedileship he identified himself more and more with the
popular faction‚ and even dared to restore some of the statues and
trophies of MariuS, which had been banished from sight seventeen
years before by the order of Sulla. The people began to hope for
a successful revival of the M arian party and to look to Caesar as its
leader-

1.28‚ 29·] Campazgn against Ariovistus. 287

Gauls had no alphabet of their own. The Druids made use of Greek let-
ters (Bk. vi. ch. 14), but the Gauls in general seem to have been ignorant of
thern (Bk. v. ch. 48). Specimens of Gallie names on coins appear in the
names DUBNOREx, AIVICIACOS, VERcmGEToRIXS. See Fig. 29, Fig. 82.

Haedui, this reckoning would show an actual loss, in slain or captives
(to be sold as slaves), in this short campaign, of nearly 2 5o,ooo, includ-
ing probably about 150,000 women and children or other non-combatantS. ·
The carnage seems extraordinary even under the conditions of ancient
warfare. But, as in all battles, many more must have escaped than the

record showed.

CAMPAmN AGAmsr AR1OV1srus.— The latter half of this Book is taken up
with the expulsion of a military settlement of Germans, which had been made a few
years before under Ariovistus, a chief of the Suevi.

The occasion of this new campaign was the following: The Haedui, jealous of
the Sequani, who lived a little to the north, had laid excessive tolls on their trade,
which consisted chiefly in the export of salted meats for the southern market. This
led to a war, in which the Sequani had invited the aid of the Germans under Ario-
vistuS‚ about three years before the campaign of Caesar. The Germans, once in
Gaul, had exacted a large share of territory and proved to be grasping and oppres-
sive masters. Meanwhile the Helvetian war began to threaten. The Roman Senate,

’ to make safe, passed the decrees before mentioned, promising favor and friendship

to the Haedui (ch. 11) ; and at the same time sent messengers to Ariovistus, saluting
him as king and friend (ch. 35), recognizing his claims on Gaul, and, it was said,
inviting him to Rome. This was the year before, in Caesar's consulship. Now,
however, that the fear of the Helvetians was passed, Caesar found himself obliged to
take sides in the old quarrel.

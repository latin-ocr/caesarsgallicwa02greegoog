286 Notes .· Cae'sar. [B. G·

255 CHAP. 28. quod: accustom yourself to the common use of the
relative, where our idiom expects a demonstrative or personaL—quorum:
the antecedent is his (dat.) following imperavit, the dir. object of which is ’
uti . . . reducerent.

25 6 sibi: dat. of reference; ἓ 378 (235. b); B. 188. 1. N.; G. 352;
H. 425. 4 (384. 4. N.3); H-B. 370.—purgati: perfect participle used as
an adj.; §495 (291. b); B. 337. 2; G. 250. R.²; H. 640. 3 (550. N.2);
H-B. 320. iii. ἡ

25 7 reductos . . . habuit: i.e. he massacred them all.

25 8 in deditionem accepit: by this act they became formally the
subjects of the Republic‚ and were entitled to its protection, as well as
required to obey its requisitions and pay tribute.

25 11 reverti, turn back (from a march or Journey: redire, go back, from
a place of rest). — frugibus: grain and other field produce.

25 12 tolerarent: best regarded as a purpose clause like, “ nothing [for]
to eat,''—§ 531. 2 (317)‚—but referred by manyaegrammarians to the
“ characteristic ’' use of the relative3 B. 283. 2; G. 631. 2; H. 591. 1
(503. i) ; H-B. 517. 2 and α. The two constructions‚ having grown up side
by side in Latin, were very often confounded.

25 13 ipsos: the Helvetians and their allies as opposed to the others
who were to provide food.

25 14 ea ratione, witlz tlzis view.

2518 Allobrogibus: these were within the Province, but the Latin
often adds an explanatory word by means of que. The Helvetii were
thus in the Roman manner stationed as a kind of colony on the frontier
towards Germany. The wisdom of the Romans in the defence of their
Empire is not less remarkable than their prowess in war.

2519 petentibus Haeduis, to tlte Haeu'zu‘, at tlzcir request: dat. after
concessit, of which the object is ut Boios conlocarent. The Haedui were
anxious for this accession to their strength because they were oppressed
by the Sequani (cf. 27 21 ff.). It will be remembered that the Boii were
emigrating when they joined the Helvetians and had no proper home to
return t0. The Haedui gave them land between the Elaver and the Liger
rivers, and they appear later in several parts of Gaul. Their prowess in
war made them valuable allies.

26 1 parem . . . atque ipsi erant, equal witlz themselves: § 324. c (156.
a. 4); B. 341. 1. c; G. 643; H. 508. 5 (451. 5); Η-Β. 307. 2. a.

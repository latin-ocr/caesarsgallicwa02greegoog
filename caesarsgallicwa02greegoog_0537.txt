strongly impressed the minds of the Romans at home, and so, too, the
passage into Britain, though the last was in fact a failure. But, though

Sacom) ΙΝνΑειοΝ 012 BR1TA1N.— The landing of the previous year had been
only a reconnaissance. Caesar now determines upon a regular advance and occupa-
tion. The earlier part of the season was chiefly taken up with naval preparations.
The ships were apparently built on the inland streamS, and the rigging and outfit
brought from Spain, which was considerably in advance of Gaul in civilization.
It abounded in metals, and, in particular, furnished the esparto, or Spanish grass,
whose long, tough fibre made the best of cordage. Caesar sails <by the reckoning of
Napoleon 111) on the zoth of July from Portus Itius, at or near Boulogne, drifting
first with wind and tide some distance to the northeast‚ then making his way to his
former landing.

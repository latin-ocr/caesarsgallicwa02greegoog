and anxiety for the welfare of his soldierS, his patience and forbear-
ance with their mistakeS, such as no modern commander has exhibited
in his memoim, and, above all, recall his mercy to his opponents in
the Civil War, whom he freely pardoned and restored to honor and
favor. Contrast Caesar's dictatorship with the horrors of Marius and
Sulla, and we cannot wonder that his clemency became famous.

That Caesar was a skeptic is no doubt true. The age was skeptical
and the learned classes no longer believed in the gods of their fore-
fatherS. What Caesar's real beliefs were, or if he had any, we do
not know. He often speaks of fortune as ruling in the affairs of men,
and probably had some vague and dimly defined belief in a supreme
power.

VI. CAEsAR’s LITERARY Wonx.

As a man of letters Caesar is hardly less eminent. His vast and
massive intellect could hold in its grasp a great variety of subjectS.
He wrote on many different themeS, such as philosophy, language‚
astronomy‚ and divination. Of all his books only his Commentaries
on the Gallie and Civil Wars have come down to us in complete

The style of these memoirs is remarkable for directneSS, terseneSS‚
and simplicity. Cicero, one of the greatest masters of style, says of
them, “I pronounce them indeed to be very commendable, for they
are simple, straight-forward‚ agreeable, with all rhetorical ornament
stripped from them as one strips off a garment.'’ While the lan-
guage is lucid, it is packed full of meaning, and even a good Latinist
needs to read slowly and with deliberation that the full thought of
each sentence may be gathered. Sometimes a whole sentence is
crammed into an adjective or a participle. To translate into good
‘English requireS, therefore, frequent amplification.

Like all great men, Caesar rarely speaks of himself. In his works
he refers to himself in the third person and with such modesty and

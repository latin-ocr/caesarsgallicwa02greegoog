5. Piles (sublicae) are then driven in below, resting obliquely against
the loge, to which they serve as shores or buttresses (pro ariete), and
other heavier piles a little way above, to break the force of floating logs
or boats sent down to destroy the bridge.

. . . defixerat, etc.: cum here equals whenever or as often as and the clause
is equivalent to the protasis of a general condition; hence the use of the
pluperf. indic.; cf. 84 22 and note.

103 26 sublicae modo, like a pile.

103 27 ut . . . procumberent, so as to lean fhrward in tke direction of the
current.

103 29 ab inferiore parte, downstream.— contra . . . conversa, slanting
against, agrees with duo [tegna]

103 30 haec utraque . . . distinebantur, these two sets (or pairs) were
held apart by two-foot timbers laid on above. equal [in thickness] to the intera
val left by thefastening of tlte piles (quantum . distabat), with a pair qs
ties at each end. For number of utraque, see Vocab.

104 2 quibus [tegnis] . . . revinctis, aster tlzese were held apart and
secured ln opposite directions: i.e. the horizontal beams held the piles
(ttjg-na) apart, which, sloping in opposite directionS, had been secured by
the clampS.

104 4 rerum, structure: see note on 4 4.—quo maior . . . hoc attius:
tlte greater . . . the more closely, abl. of degree of difference. The, only.
doubtful part of the description is in fibulis, of which the exact meaning is
somewhat uncertain. They are thought by some to be cross-ties (as in
Fig. 80). But, as the word means properly a kind of clasp exactly like a·
modern safety-pin, it seems better to suppose they were clamps joining the
two piles with perhaps an iron bolt put through, answering to the pin of
the fibula.

’104 5 haec . . . contexebantur, these (the framework of timber) were
covered with boards placed lengtltwise.
³ 104 7 sublicae . . . agebantur, piles also were driven on tlte lower side
in a slanting direction, so as to prop the bridge against the current.

104 8 pro ariete, as a buttress. ’

104 10 aliae item: other piles a little way above, to serve as a break-
water. There is nothing in the text to show whether these were attached
to the bridge or not.—spatio: abl. of degree of difference.

V. 36-43.] Freslz Risings os tlte Gauls. 395

144 10 praeustae sudes: heavy stakes or piles of wood, sharpened
at the end, and charred to harden the point. They were hurled by the
tormenta ‚· see F ig. 61.— muralium pilorum: javelins heavier than usual
for the defence of the wall.

144 11 contabulantur, were floored with plank. Possibly also the
towers were connected by galleries, one for each story.

144 12 cum: concessive.

144 14 concursu ac vocibus, by the spontaneous movement and entreaties.

144 18 CHAP. 41. potestate: see note on 16 7.

144 23 errare . . . si . . . sperent: simple condition, indir. disc.; cf.
137 19.—qui: referring to eis.

144 24 hoc: with animo.

144 25 ut, etc.: i.e. they will be friendS, but not subjects; they only
refuse to admit a standing military force.

145 2 se adiutore utantur (for the imv. of dir. disc), they may use him
as an advocate.

145 5 CHAP. 42. hac spe: i.e. of betraying Cicero as they had be·
trayed Sabinus—fossa pedum quindecim: a ditch 15 ft. wide would be
11 ft. deep.

145 8 ab his: i.e. the captives—nulla . . . copia, having no supply,

etc. (a sort of abl. abs). “ They were not yet used, like the RomanS, to
fight with the spade.’'
· 145 10 manibus sagulisque . . . exhaurire, to dtgr out with their hands,
and [carry] in their cloaks. A kind of zeugma, §640 (385); B. 374. 2. a;
G. 690; H. 751. 2. N. (636. ii. 1); H-B. 631. 73 but, as usual in such caseS,
the meaning of the verb really covers the thought by implication.

145 13 XV: probably an error, as a circuit of fifteen miles seems out
of the question; perhaps pedum, or else V, instead of XV.

145 14 falcis, books: see note on 84 22—testudines: wooden gal-
leries or shedS, to protect the undermining (see Figs. 33, 126).

145 21 clamore: see 142 4.

145 26 non modo, etc.: needs a “pulpit ” paraphrase, which, after all,
would be, like many, less forcible than the original. Omit the bracketed
wordS.

146 2 pugnarent: same construction as respiceret and decederet.

146 5 ut, etc.: this use of ut, as, is almost precisely parallel to the
English causal, as, inas-much as. In fact, the expressions have really the
same origin.

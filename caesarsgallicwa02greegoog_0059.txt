Gaul and tlte Gauh. xlvii

The PhoenicianS, those pioneer traders and intrepid sailors of antiq-
uity, had had commercial dealings with the Gauls at a very remote
period. Several centuries later, but still at an early date (about B.c.
600), the Greeks had made a settlement near the mouth of the Rhone,
which afterwards grew into the prosperous city of Massilia (Marseilles)‚
and opened up some trade routes into the interior. Both Phoenicians
and Greeks found the most powerful part of the Celts already well
established in western Europe, and showing evidence of previous
possession for a period going back of any assignable date.

The Celts had been for centuries a migratory and always a warlike
people. These characteristics led them into many 'countries where
they made settlements of more or less importance. Besides those
who occupied Gaul proper, there were Iberian Celts (Celtiberi) in
Spain, British Celts, Belgic Ceus, Italian Celts in northern Italy,
Celts in the Alps (notably the Helvetii), Illyrian Celts, and Asiatic
Celts‚ who had settled in Asia Minor and were known as GalatianS.
It was to them, after they were Christianized, that Paul wrote his
well-known epistle.

What knowledge the Greeks and Romans had of this powerful
nation of barbarians was extremely vague. They had long hung like
a dark storm-cloud on the northern frontier of both countrieS, and at
intervals poured forth in overwhelming and destructive numberS.
Once they spread desolation and dismay through Greece, and all but
succeeded in plundering the rich temple of Delphi. In 13.c. 390
Rome was destroyed by these same barbarianS, and in 13.c. 102 it
was only the military genius of C. Marius that spared Italy a similar
visitation.

Long before the time of Caesar, the Romans had succeeded in sub-
duing the Gauls south of the Alps, making the prosperous and orderly
province of Cisalpine Gaul, as related above. Transalpine Gaul and
· Illyricum were more recent additions to the empire‚ and were less
thoroughly subdued and civilized. . They had been finally conquered
by Q. Fabius Allobrogicus. All to the north had as yet been un-
explored and uninvaded by Roman arms, The GauIS, according to
circumstances and location‚ showed at this time various degrees of
civilization. Those to the south and west, being nearer to the refine-
ment of the province, had made rapid strides, had built many

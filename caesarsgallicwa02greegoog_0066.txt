THE CAMPAIGNS IN GAUL.

Tun campaigns of Caesar in Gaul lasted through eight seasons
(B.c. 58-51), and are told in eight bookS, —the last written by
HirtiuS, an officer of Caesar,— each book containing the operations
of a single year. The following is a brief outline:

Book 1. B.c. 58. Caesar checks the attempt of the Helvetians to
settle in Western Gaul, and, after a bloody⁴ defeat, forces the remnant
to return to their own territory. He then engages with a powerful
tribe of Germans, who had made a military settlement in Eastern Gaul,
and drives them, with their chief, AriovistuS, back across the Rhine.

Book 11. 13.c. 57. A formidable confederacy of the northern popula-
tions of Gaul is suppressed, with the almost complete extermination of

the bravest Belgian tribe, the Nervii, in a battle which seems to have -

been one of the most desperate of all that Caesar ever fought. In
this campaign the coast towns of the west and northwest (Brittany)
also are reduced to submission.

Book 111. 13.c. 56. After a brief conflict with the mountaineers of

- the Alps, who attacked the Roman armies on their march, the chief

operations are the conquest of the coast tribes of Brittany (Veneti,
etc.), in a warfare of curious naval engineering in the‘shallow tide-
water inlets and among the rocky shoreS. During the season, the
tribes of the southwest (Aquitani), a mining population‚ allied to
the Iberians or BasqueS‚ are reduced by one of Caesar's Officers,

Book IV. B.c. 55. An inroad of the Germans into Northern Gaul
is repulsed‚ and Caesar follows them by a bridge of timber hastily built
across the Rhine. Returning, he crosses to Britain in the early
autumn for a visit of exploration.

Book V. 13.c. 54. The partial conquest of Britain (second invasion)
is followed by various movements in N orthern Gaul, in which the des-
perate condition of the Roman garrisons is relieved after serious losses
by the prudent and brave conduct of Labienus and Quintus Cicero.

Book VI. B.c. 53. Caesar makes a second brief expedition across
the Rhine against the Germans. Some general disturbances are
quelled, and N orthern Gaul is reduced to peace.

The Life of Caius julius Caesar. xv

Another menace to the government was in the constitution of the
armies, After a man had been consul, he was given charge of a

Ι province and was put in command of several legions. While abroad

he was not amenable to the government at home, and when he
returned he used his old soldiers to further his politica] schemeS, and
rewarded them at the expense of the opposing faction, often by

its task 3 and the only resource against anarchy appears to have been
that some one man, by craft or by force, should get all the reins of
power into his single hand. That man was destined to be Julius

of the Roman nation and reputed to be the son of a goddess,

The time of his birth was during the great ascendancy of the
Populares under MariuS, his uncle3 and his childhood was passed
amid the horrors os the proscriptions that marked Marius's dictator-
ship. Though Caesar was connected by blood with the oldest and

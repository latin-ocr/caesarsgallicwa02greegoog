xxvi Introduction.

What Alexander was to the Greeks, and Hannibal to the Cartha·
ginianS, that and much more was Caesar to the Romans. The two
former excelled all men of their times in war only3 but Caesar had
such extraordinary abilities in widely different directions that many
regard him as the most remarkable man that history records. In
whatever he did, he always did the best possible. He had the great-
est diversity of gifts ε as a student of language‚ he composed a treatise
on grammar while crossing the Alps; as an orator, Quintilian says
he would have rivalled Cicero had he devoted his time to this art; as
a general, he has had no superior and hardly a peer ; and, above all,
he was the greatest politician and statesman of his time. To his
statecraft all his other acts are subordinate, and by this they should
be interpreted.

Caesar was too great a man to be without enemieS. He has been
accused of being a traitor to his country, who by a deep-laid scheme
overthrew its constitution. He was undoubtedly ambitious for power,
and he used it in making such changes in the constitution as were
sorely needed to keep it from going to pieces 3 but how far the acts
by which he accomplished this desirable end were the result of a
plan to further his personal ambition‚ and how far they were com—
pelled by the stress of circumstanceS, we cannot judge. We do
know, however, that he professed an earnest desire for peace, until
he was driven into war by the hatred and perversity of his opponentS.

He has also been accused of immorality, cruelty‚ and irreligion.
It would be vain to maintain that Caesar was a model of virtue in
an 'age that was notoriously and openly wicked and profligate. We
know that Caesar was a man of perfect seli-control, and that he was
remarkable for extreme abstemiousness in eating and drinking. As
for the rest, he was probably no worse than the average.

Doubtless he was cruel‚ judged by modern standardS. He butch-
ered without mercy thousands of defenceless men, women, and chil-
dren. But we must remember that Caesar was a Roman, of a people
naturally cruel and careless of bloodshed, and, again, that he was
dealing with Gauls and GermanS‚ whom the Romans despised, and
for whom he had not, nor could have, any feelings of sympathy or
kindness. The doctrine of human brotherhood is something he never
heard of. But, on the other hand, contrast with this his constant care

on the British ooast. His cavalry, meanwhile, had been weatherbound in their
transport8‚ and then, after crossing‚ were driven back by rough winds, so that they
did not even come to land. After holding an uneasy and perilous position for about
three weeks, he returned to Gaul without accomplishing anything beyond a barren
display of daring. This expedition was, in fact, only intended for a ‘⁴ demonstration.”
Yet, as the beginning of the national history of England, the event assumes great
interest and importance, so that it has given rise to volumes of comment and discus·

105 20 fore: the subject is practically the clause si . . . cognovisset, he

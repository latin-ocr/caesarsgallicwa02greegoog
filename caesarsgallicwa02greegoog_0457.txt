The three relatives qui (l. 16), quod (1. 17), and quod (l. 21) illustrate
the principle that the relative, serving to connect with the previous propo·
sition, may represent various conjunctions: if then lte should not withdraw
(qui=is igrttur); and if lte should kill lu'm (quod, adv. acc.); but if lte
should withdraw (quod=sed, ete.).

Neque mea neque populi Romani consuetudo patitur uti optime meritos
socios deseram, neque ego iudico Galliam potius esse Ariovisti quam populi
Romani. Bello superati sunt Arverni et Ruteni ab Q. Fabio MaximO,
quibus populus Romanus ignovit neque in provinciam redegit neque stipen—
dium imposuit. Quod si antiquissimum quodque tempus spectari oportet,
populi Romani iustissimum est in Gallia imperium; si iudicium senatus
observari oportet, libera debet esse Gallia, quam bello victam suis legibus
uti voluerit.

41 9 CHAP. 46. geruntur: for tense after dum, cf. 24 24, 33 19.

41 10 tumulum: governed by propius, which sometimes has the force
of a prep.; §432 a (261. a); B. 141. 3; G. 416. 223 H. 420. 5 (437. 1);

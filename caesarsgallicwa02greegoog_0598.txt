440 Notes .· Caesar. [B. G.

cingetorix where he had placed himself was out of the question; but to
blockade him there, to capture the leader of the insurrection and his
whole army, and so in one blow make an end with it, on a survey of the
situation seemed not impossible.”—Froude's “Caesar.'' See plan, Fig.
103.

233 2 CHAP. 69. loco: in app. with colle; cf. 5282. d (184. c);

233 7 sub muro, etc.: this sentence is an excellent example, at the
same time, both of the natural precedence of the relative in Latin and of
the freedom of all real language from grammatical trammels. The student
should first translate it literally thus: Under the wall, which side qs the hill
(i.e. the side which) saced tlte cast, all this space tlte forces qs the Gauls had
filled, and had carried along a ditch, etc. The meaning of this is obviouS,
but it is not at all in accordance with our English idiom. Indeed‚ it is not
strictly grammatical in any language. After the student has seen what it
meanS, he should try to put it into some form that is allowable in English
idiom, say: Under the wall, tlte side . . .‚ all this space the fhrces . . ., and
had made there, etc.

233 20 pro castris: these were on the high ground south of the city
(see plan, Fig. 102); castris is plural,=camps.

233 23 angustioribus, too narrem, either from unskilful construction
or more easily to prevent the enemy's entrance. The gates referred to were
in the stone wall (maceria) 3 see plan.

233 24 acrius, with all the more vigor.

234 1 veniri . . . existimantes, thinking that an immediate attack is

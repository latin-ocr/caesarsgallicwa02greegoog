62 8 consuetudine sua, in accordance with his custom.

62 9 ducebat: for the order of march, see chapter on military affairs,
vl. —conlocarat, had put in place [of greatest safety]; this verb (conloco)
is often confounded by beginners with conltgro, collect.

62 10 proxime conscriptae, latest levied. These were legions xm and
XIV, mentioned in 50 1, 2, which were not yet sufficiently trained to bear
the brunt of the fight.

62 11 praesidio impedimentis: cf. 54 3, 55 1, 56 4.

62 13 cum, etc.: this clause describes the situation, and is shown to
be temporal by interim, which follows (cf. 53 8, 53 1ο, 60 3). This move·
ment is important because it allowed time for the main body to arrive and
begin the camp, contrary to the expectation of the Nervii.

62 14 reciperent . . . facerent, kept retiring‚ etc. (strengthened by
identidem).

62 15 quem ad finem: the antecedent attracted into the relative
clause, according to the Latin idiom. Translate as if it were ad finem ad
quem, which, however, the Romans would rarely say.

62 16 cedentis agrees with eos, the understood object of insequi.
Notice that the Romans can always omit a pronoun if its case is deter-
mined by some word in agreement.

62 17 opere dimenso, having staked out the works. See chapter on Ἰ

military affairs, v.

62 18 ubi . . . visa sunt: cf. 53 4, 56 13. Notice that this is purely
temporal. Caesar might have used cum with the subjw, but in that case it
would describe the situation. A comparison of this with 62 13 shows the
difference clearly.

62 2⁰ quod tempus, the moment which. Notice the difference of the
Latin and the English idiom3 tempus is in apposition with the clause ubi
. . . visa sunt. The attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause
is regular when it is in apposition with something preceding (cf. 30 19,
38 19, and notes).-—committendi proeli: depending on tempus. Notice
that the gen. is theregular form to connect one noun with another, though
we use various prepositionS.—ut (just as) . . . confirmaverant: ie. the
movement was not a confused sally on the individual impulse of savageS,
but an organized attack with the united and settled determination to resist
the invaders, He may have said this only to enhance the glory of his
victory, but he more than once pays tribute to the prowess of the enemy,
and he probably does so here.

62 24 ut, so that (result).

62 25 [et iam in manibus nostris]: i.e. within reach of our weapons.
This makes sense, and may be so translated.

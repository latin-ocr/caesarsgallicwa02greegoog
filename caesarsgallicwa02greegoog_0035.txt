The Life os Caius Julius Caesan xxiii

a panic to Brundisium and sailed across the Adriatic to Epirus.
Caesar meanwhile continued his victorious advance, and in sixty days
was master of Italy. Then he went to Spain, and before autumn
closed had met and defeated all opposition there. Returning to
Rome he made preparations to follow Pompey. Many prominent
Optimates had fallen into his handS, but he let them all go free, to
their own great amazement and to Caesar’s eternal praise. In a letter
he says: “I will conquer after a new fashion and fortify myself in
the possession of the power 1 acquire by generosity and mercy.’'

Caesar followed Pompey across the sea from Brundisium, transport-
ing his army in two divisionS. He encountered considerable diffi-
culty on account of storms and the lack of ships, After much skir-
mishing, anxiety, and suffering (on Caesar’s part), owing to scarcity
of food and supplieS, he fought a battle at Pharsalia in Thessaly on
Aug. 9, 13.c. 48. Before the battle Pompey’s officers felt so sure of
victory that a rich banquet was spread awaiting their return from the
field. In numbers and equipment Pompey was much superior, and
with him was all the wealth and respectability of Rome. He had
45,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry against Caesar's 22,000 and 1000,
respectively3 but he was· overwhelmingly defeated and the battle
ended in a terrible panic and great slaughter, in which 15,000 men
lost their liveS. As Caesar viewed the slain he said sadly: “They
would have it so. After all that I had done for my country, I, Gaius
Caesar, should have been condemned as a criminal if I had not
appealed to my army.'’

Pompey fled for his life and took ship to Egypt and was there
murdered by the king, who hoped thus to win Caesar’s favor. When
Caesar arrived there, however, a few days later, and Pompey's head
was presented to him, he is said to have turned away from the sight
with horror and grief. He now overcame all remaining opposition in
several short and brilliant campaigns. The first of these was in Asia
Minor, where he conquered so easily that he reported it to the senate
in the words that have since become famous: ‘⁶ Veni, vidi, vici.”
By the battle of Thapsus in Africa (13.c. 46) and that of Munda in
Spain (B.c. 45), the Pompeian party was finally crushed.

Caesar now returned to Rome, where he was made imperator—-

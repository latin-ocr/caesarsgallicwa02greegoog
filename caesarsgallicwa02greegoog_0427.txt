te. quod . . . enuntiarit.

15 19 CHAP. 18. pluribus praesentibus, in tlte presence of many ‚·
observe that the abl. abs, will rarely bear a literal translation, but its force
must be brought out in various wayS.

15 20 iactari, bandied about (frequentative of dacio).

15 21 Liscum retinet, [but] keeps Liscus. The omission of the conj.
(asyndeton) is very common in Caesar's rapid narrative—ex solo, from
him in private.

15 22 secreto (from secerno), each by himself.

15 23 esse vera (se. haec), that tlte facts are these. —ipsum esse Dum-
norigem, etc.: Ditem,—

lpse est Dumnorix . . . cupidus rerum novarum. Compluris annos por-
toria . . . redempta habet, . . . quod illo licente contra liceri audetnemO. His

Caesarem . . '. quod . . . frater . . . est restitutus. Si quid accidat Romanis,
summam in spem . . . venit ,· imperio populi Romani . . . de ea quam habet
gratia, desperat.

15 24 summa audacia, [a man] qf the utmost boldness. The general
word is rarely, as here, omitted after a proper name with an abl. of
quality.

15 25 rerum novarum: the regular expression for a change of govern—
ment, revolution, or coup d’e‘tat. Such overturnings seem to have been
frequent in Gaul. ——portoria‚ customs dues or tolls, levied at the frontier;
collected, apparently, as by the Romans, through publicani, who bid for the
contract at public auction and made what they could above the contract
price. The Haedui controlled at least a part of the Saone, which was „a
water-way into the centre of Gaul. It was customary among the ancients
to levy tolls or blackmail on goods passing through their territories.

16 l redempta: agreeing with vectigalia, and taken with habere, lead
bought in (cf. 8 9, 13 4).

16 7 causa, sor the sake: as always when thus following a gem—poten-
tiae, power, as an attribute of the person3 potestas is power to do anything;
facultas, opportunity; imperium, military authority.

16 8 Biturigibus: near the modern Bourges, west of the Haedui.

1 7 cultu, civilization, as shown by outward signs, dreSS, and habits
of life—humanitate, refinement, of mind or feeling—provinciae: the
province of Gallia Narbonensis, organized about B.C. 120. Its chief cities
were Massilia (Marsez’lles), an old Greek free city, and the capital, Narbo

(Narbonne), a Roman colony. The name Provincia has come down to us
in the modern Provence.

1 8 mercatores: these were traders or peddlers, mostly from the sea-
port of Massilia; they travelled with pack-horses‚ muleS‚ and wagons. A
very common article of traffic‚ as with our Indian traders, was intoxicating
drinks‚—wines from the southern coast, which, especially, as Caesar says,
‘⁴ tend to debauch the character.'’ These people, it is said, would give the
traders a boy for a jar of wine. — commeant: this verb means, especially,
to go back ancl forth in the way of trafflc. The main line of trade lay across
the country, by the n'ver Liger (Loire).—ea: object of important.

Rhine was, in general, the boundary between the Gauls and the Germans,
and has so remained till modern times—continenter (adverb from the
participle of contineo, hold together), incessantly ,· strictly, without any inter·
ruption. The pupil should begin at once to notice the way in which words
develop into groups expressing the same idea in the forms of the various
parts of speech. See p. 449.

¹¹ Here not the conspiracy itself, but the aim of it is the most important part of the idea.
¹² The main subject of discourse, ‘⁴ now this conspiracy, the reports said,“ etc.
¹³ The difference between “the reasons why were tltese'’ and “these were tlte reasons

²⁸ Notice that the view of the first party is a rational idea seriously thought out, to which
implied state of mind the t‘nconstancy of the second party is opposed.

162 18 demonstravimus: see Bk. v. chs. 3, 4, and 56.

162 24 CHAP. 9. paulo supra, a little above, or to the south.

162 25 nota . . . ratione, on the plan already tried and approved (cf.

163 10 eis . . . imperio : subject tribeS, not confederate allieS. TacituS‚
however (Ger. 38), represents the Suevi as a confederacy; its former sub-
jects may, after Caesar’s time, have been admitted to alliance.

163 18 quaeque: -que connects mittant and cognoscant.

163 22 silvam: this was the natural frontier and defence (pro nativo
muro) of the north German plain towards the south. A range of wooded
hills still borders the Saxon duchies on the north. The Cherusci held the
valleys of the Weser and Elbe.

164 1 CHAP. 11. locum, ete.: here there is really nothing to tell, as
Caesar found the country deserted (ch. 29), and returned at once to Gaul.
We owe to this void in the narrative a most curious and entertaining
glimpse into the geographie and ethnographic knowledge of the time. See
the introductory Chapters on Gaul and Germany.

164 7 existimantur: is only explanatory, hence the indicative.

164 8 quorum: the antecedent is principes.

164 9 redeat: is characteristic; ξ 535 (320); B. 2833 G. 631. 13 H.
591. 1 (503. i); cf. H-B. 521. 1. The idea seems to be: It is the chief
men of these factions (those namely who are regarded as most influential)

who have the supreme authority. Hence the effort of each of the chief· ι

tains to look out for his dependentS.

taking its time from institutum [esse] : ς 485. j, 585. a (287. i, 336. Β. Nfl) ς
Β. 268. 7. b, 268. 2 ; G. 518; H. 548 (495. iv); H-B. 483.

164 13 haec . . . Galliae, this same state qf things exists in general
throughout entire Gaul.

164 14 divisae: adj. use of the participle; cf. divisa, 1 1.

164 15 CHAP. 12. cum . . . venit: notice the difference between this
and the cum in descriptive clauses (cf. 11 7, 49 1). Here it means merely “at
the time when,’' and there is no inner connection with the main clause.

164 16 Sequani: these succeeded to the-domination of the Arverni

(see Bk. i. ch. 31). —hi, the latter.

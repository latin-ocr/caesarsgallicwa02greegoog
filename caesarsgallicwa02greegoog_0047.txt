Roman Militaaey A ffairS. xxxv

The cavalry and light-armed troops and all separate detachments
carried only the vexillum (Bk. vi. 36). The general's flag at head-
quarters was also called vexillum. It was a large white banner
with an inscription in red, giving the name of the general and that
of his army. A large red vexillum displayed at headquarters was
the signal for battle (Bk. ii. 20). See F ig. 70.

111. THE Musm.

The difficulty of carrying the voice through the din of battle early
led the Romans to use the penetrating tones of brass instruments for
giving orderS. The four instruments used by them were the bugle
(bucina), the trumpet (tuba), the cavalry trumpet (lituus), and the
horn (cornu). See F igs. 36, 37, 38, 84.

The bucina, whose shape and appearance are uncertain, sounded
the changes of the night-watch and the reveille in the morning. The
tuba, a straight trumpet of brass more than three feet long, with a bell-
shaped mouth, gave the signal for attack or retreat, the signal being
taken up and repeated by the cornu. The latter was a circular-
shaped instrument which the performer often placed about his neck.
The tuba had a deep tone 3 the cornu a sharper one. The general's
call to an assembly (contio) was the classicum, sounded by all the
instruments at once.

IV. THE LEGIONARY.

a. Enlistment. —- The legion was composed of Romans only. Citi- .
zens were liable to conscription between the ages of seventeen and
forty-six. The recruit must be of sound health and of suitable height.
The Romam, as a rule, were rather undersized. Caesar expressly
mentions the small stature of his troops as compared with that of
the Germans (Bk. i. 393 ii. 3o); but the Romans had learned the
lesson of civilization, —that victories are gained not by huge bones
and big bodieS, but by trained skill and scientific tactiCS. Man for
man, the Germans were doubtless more th an a match for the Romans ;
but against the organized and disciplined legion — the most effective
machine for battle that the world had yet seen — they were almost

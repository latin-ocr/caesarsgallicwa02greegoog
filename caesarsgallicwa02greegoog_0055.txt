Roman Military Α ffairs. xliii

It was begun at a distance from the wall, very nearly out of reach of
the missiles of the enemy. It was then gradually extended in the
direction of the point to be attacked, and was at the same time
gradually increased in height until on a level with the top of the wall,
or even higher. At Avaricum the mound was 80 feet high (Bk.
vii. 23-28). Its width was possibly 40 or 50 feet. It was made
of earth and timber, and had connected galleries running through its
various stories‚ through which the soldiers could move under cover
(see Fig. 120). The men engaged in constructing the agger had to
be protected from the enemy. Those who were building worked
behind lines of plutei (see F igs. 130, 131), large standing shield3‚
which were moved forward from time to time as the agger progressed.
Those bringing material for the builders walked under rows of sheds
called vineae (see F igs. 33, 120), extending the length of the agger.
The workmen were protected also by archers and slingers and by
engines of war (tormenta) standing behind lines of plutei or upon
movable towers (turres). The latter stood on the agger or on
either side of it, and advanced with it, and as they advanced increased
in height story by story. As the workmen get nearer the wall the
plutei will no longer protect them. Then they find refuge under
strong sheds of wood called testudines or musculi, placed at the
ends of lines of vineae.

When the mound has reached the wall, a breach is made through
it for the final assault (expugnatio). Sometimes this was accom-
plished by undermining the wall, or it was pulled down from the top
with huge iron hooks ( falces murales). But the most common and
most effective means was the battering ram (aries), a huge swinging
bearn from 60 to 100 feet long with a heavy mass ot metal at one
end, often shaped like a ram's head. This under a testudo, or in the
lowest story of a tower‚ was brought with tremendous force against
the opposing masonry. When the final assault was made, soldiers
rushed in from every quarter‚ over the mound‚ through the breach,
and from the movable towerS‚ from whose highest stories draw-
bridges stretched to the walls

Against these forms of assault the inhabitants used such means of
resistance as they could. The most effective were masses of stone,
thrown from the wall upon the works, and fire. To guard against

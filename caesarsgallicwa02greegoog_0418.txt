Geneva, though that fact is not mentioned. Caesar evidently went beyond
his province without the order of the Senate, hence his explanatory tone.

before described3 see F igs. 5, 6. The entire train of the Helvetii has been
reckoned at 8500 four-horse wagonS, extending some fifty miles (ef. note on
4 23). The passage must have been extremely slow. They probably fol-
lowed in the line of the modern railroad as far as Culoz‚ then to Amberieu
and across the plateau des Dombes‘ to the Saone between Lyons and
Macon, a distance of nearly a hundred miles, It is calculated that Caesar
must have been absent two months in Italy, and the march of the Helve-
tians probably took about the same time. This would make the time of
these events about the latter part of June.

9 12 Haeduorum: it does not appear that these occupied the left bank
of the Saone. But predatory excursions may have been made across the
river, and in ch. 12 the Helvetians were engaged in crossing.

H-B. 618.—ita se, ete.: in English supply saying or some such word. In
Latin, after the idea of speech or thought is suggested, as here by legatos
and rogatum, no further expression of saying is necessary. In dir. disc.
this would be, “ Ita [nos] . . . meriti sumus, ut paene in conspectu exercitus
vestri, . . . liberi nostri . . . non debuerint'',· i.e. our services have been such,
etc„ that we did not deserve to have this happen (as it has). Probably the
account is somewhat exaggerated.

916 meritos: “Alone among the Gau15‚'' says TacituS‚ “the Haedui
claim the 'name of brotherhood with the Roman people'’ (Ann. xi. 25).
So, also, Cicero calls them fratres nostri.

9 18 debuerint: if this were stated not as a result but independently,
the form would be perf. indic„ implying that the thing had happened con·
trary to what ought to be. According to the Latin idiom, the same tense
is retained in such cases, contrary to the sequence of tenses; see ἓ 485. c.

occupying the angle between that river and the Rhone. They were evi·

kind. —consanguinei, akin by blood. '

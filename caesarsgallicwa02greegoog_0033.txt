The Life qf Caius Julius Coesar. xxi

—an interval of ten years having elapsed— he would be eligible
again as consul.

The programme was duly carried out. Crassus departed (B.C. 54)
to his province, where he was defeated the next year by the Parthians
in the battle of Carrhae, and shortly after entrapped and killed.
Pompey put his province into the hands of one of his subordinateS‚
and remained in the neighborhood of Rome, unwilling to remove
from the seat of his personal influence.

Caesar served eight campaigns in Gaul, an account of which is
contained in the eight books of his CommentarieS. Seven of these
he wrote himself. The eighth was written by his friend and staff-
officer, HirtiuS. During these years he stormed more than 800
towns and subdued 300 tribeS, engaged with more than 3,000,ooo
men, swept over a million human beings from the earth, and took a
million more prisoners to be sold into slavery. ‘⁴ He was the first to
lead an army into interior Gaul, the first to cross the Rhine into Ger-
many, the first to bring a navy into the Western Ocean or to sail into
the Atlantic with an army to make war.'’ He left a magnificent
country for the Romans to appropriate and retain until their increas-
ing corruption left it in turn an easy prey to the GermanS. He
inspired such terror of the Roman arms that the tide of barbarian
invasion was stayed for centuries.

IV. CAESAR'S LATER CAREER.

“ 'slve foremost man of all this world.”— S kakespeare.

“ Caesar could bear no superior, Pompey no equal.”— Lucan.

Meanwhile events had been moving on at Rome. With Crassus
dead, Caesar and Pompey were left in the enjoyment of almost abso-
lute authority. They had been friends from youth, but none the less
rivals, and the death of Julia (13.c. 54) sundered the last ties that bound
them together. In 52 Pompey had been made sole consul and found
himself at the head of a party which, under cover of the constitution,
was determined to destroy Caesar that it might retain the power which ⁴
his reforms threatened to place in worthier handS.

Caesar’s proconsulship ot‘ Gaul would expire at the end of 13.c. 49.

He wished to run for a second consulship in B.C. 48. The senate

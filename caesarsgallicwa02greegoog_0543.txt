V. 8-12.] Second Invasion of Britain. 385

124 17 eoram perspicit: i.e. after a careful and thorough personal
examination. Caesar did not leave important duties of this sort to subordi-
nateS. —sic ut, ete. : i.e. he sees that the account of the disaster is true to
the extent that, ete.; ut and similar words often have a limiting meaning3
cf. tantum, meaning only so much.

124 19 fabros deligit: a certain number of carpenters (fabri ltgnarii)
was attached to the engineer corps of the army, but Caesar seems to have

had no regular engineer eorpS‚ except that a praefectus fabrum was on his
staff. See chapter on military affairS, 1. 4.

124 20 legionibus: abl. of means.

124 26 easdem quas, tlze same as .· see 122 27.

124 27 eodem: i.e. to the British defenees on the Stour.; cf. note on
120 8.

125 4 a mari: probably from Caesar’s place of landing. The distance
is reckoned, not in a straight line, but by the roads, as the army marched.

125 5 huic, etc. : “ The brave and cautious prince Cassivellaunus
(Caswallon)‚ who ruled in what is now Middlesex and the surrounding dis·
trict‚—formerly the terror of the Celts to the south of the ThameS‚ but
now the protector and champion of the whole nation.'’ (Mommsen.)—huic
. . . cum reliquis civitatibus . . . intercesserant, had occurred between him
and the other states ; note the idiomatic construction.

125 8 CHAP. 12. natos in insula: they were not, however, indigenouS,
but a Celtic population following an earlier Iberian race.

125 9 proditum [esse]: the subject is quos natos [esse] in insula.—
pars: sc. incolitur.

125 11 eis nominibus: for example, Atrebates and Belgae.

126 3 Gallicis: brief references to the Gallie customs of building are
made in Bk. v. ch. 43, and Bk. vi. ch. 3o; see also introductory chapter on
Gaul and the Gauls.

126 4 [aut nummo aereo]: omit in translation.

126 6 plumbum album: Caesar is mistaken in placing tin mines inland
and iron on the coast: it was just the other way. The tin mines of Corn-
wall were known to the Phoenicians from the earliest times. He does not
say whether iron was used in the artS, which, if true, would imply a pretty
advanced civilization.

126 7 exigua: the great mineral wealth of England was then unknown.

126 9 fagum atque abietem: another error; the beech and fir are both
native to Britain.

126 10 gallinam, etc.: it is of interest to note that these domestic
fowls were known to the savage Britons; see Fig. 1 13·

126 12 frigoribus, seasons of cold.

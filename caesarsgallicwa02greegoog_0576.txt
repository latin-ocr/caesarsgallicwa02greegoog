WAn 012 Vancmceron1x.—The last three campaigns had been conducted
wholly in the north, with a view either to crush the bolder and more restless northern
populations», or to overawe the more barbarous Britons and Germans beyond the
frontier. 1t is not quite clear why the discontented spirits of the south did not seize
the occasion to join forces with the formidable Belgian revolt. At all events, they
seemed quiet and submissive after their defeats in the earlier campaigns, and might
have continued so but for the execution oi Acco (Bk. vi. ch. 44), which had aroused
the spirit of all the Gallie nobility, and the news from Rome, where the hostile aris·
tocracy had long been waiting for some opportunity to check Caesar in his career of
conquest and call him home.

This opportunity seemed to offer in the disorders which followed the death of
Clodius. Clodius was a bully and professional politician belonging to the popular
party, a bitter enemy of Cicero, whom he had succeeded, a few years before, in driv-
ing into exile. He was killed in a street brawl on the zoth of January of this year
by Milo, a ruffian of the senatorial or aristocratic party. For the time, all regular
and orderly government was at an end, till at length Pompey was invested with dicta·
torial powers, and quiet was restored. The news of these events coming to Gaul gave
the native leaders reasonable ground to hope that a new uprising might be success·
ful. Their plan, it will appear, was, by a sudden movement, to cut off Caesar's com·
munications with his military posts in the north, which would thus be speedily
starved into surrender. This plan Caesar foiled by striking, with his usual rapidity‚
through their line, and through the neutra] or hostile populations of Central Gaul,
and so advancing upon his assailants with the support of his legions from the north.
His campaign of this year was the most fiercely contested, as well as the most
important and decisive, οἱ the entire war.

N. 3.- In this book the editors have purposely abstained from grammatical com-
ment except such as seemed necessary for the interpretation of the text, in order
that the student might have one book of Caesar’s Commentaries‚ and that one of the
finest pieces of simple narrative in literature, to enjoy without trying to see how the
words were parsed. Grammar is absolutely necessary for Latin, but there is much in
Latin besides grammar. Intelligent reading presupposes that, but does not always
have it uppermost.

Gaul and tlte Gauls, li

taining only a nominal independence under the protection of some
larger one. They were for the most part ruled by a turbulent and
oppressive aristocracy, sometimes with an elected chief magistrate.
But sometimes an ambitious leader‚ like Orgetorix, succeeded in
establishing sor a time a kingly power. Thus the several states
were torn by hostile parties, and were at the same time grouped into
national factionS, under the lead of the more powerful stateS. At
the time of Caesar, royalty had been almost abolished, and yearly
magistrates (vergobrets) were elected instead. Every year represen-
tatives from the different states met in assembly, and questions of
national policy were discussed. Owing to the violent and excitable
natures of the Gauls, these assemblies often ended in tumultuous
scenes of disorder. ’

At the commencement of war, a call to arms was sounded‚ to
whichold and young responded. The last man to appear was put
to death with tortures in the presence of the assembled people.

j: Religion. — The Druids. — Caesar says that the Gauls were
devoted to religious matters, They were under the control of a class
of priests known as Druids, who acted not only as priests, but also as
arbiters and judgeS. By them was treasured the religious and philo-
sophie lore of the GauIS, and to them the Gallic youth went for
instruction, some of them remaining in training as long as twenty
yearS. One of their most important doctrines was that of the trans-
migration of souIS. Belief in immortality gave the Gauls a contempt
for death which enabled them to face the greatest dangers without
flinching.

The Druids gave their instructions and performed their bloody
sacrifices in the depths of the forest. The oak and the mistletoe
were sacred in their eyes, The mysterious rites of their worship are
not well known, but many cruel and horrible practices are attributed
to them by ancient writerS, among them human sacrifices. Caesar
mentions these, but did not know of their actual occurrence from per-
sonal observation.

The principal religious observances of the Gauls were gradually
abolished under Roman rule, but many of them were ‘baptized'
into Christianity and survive to-day in various modified forms as a
part os the popular religion.

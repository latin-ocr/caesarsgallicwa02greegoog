service could always expect a considerable increase in his income from
booty and from the gifts of his general.

i. Discipline.— The martial spirit of the soldiers and their atten-
tion to duty were maintained and increased by appropriate rewards
and punishmentS. Among the latter the most usual were withholding
of wageS, degradation in rank, corporal punishment, dismissal from
the service, and, in cases of flagrant offenceS‚ death. A minor offence
committed by a company of soldiers was punished by putting them
on barley rations and giving them extra work on the fortifications.
Among rewards may be mentioned public praise in the presence of
the army, promotion in rank, increase in wageS, or the. presentation
of a crown of leaves or grasseS, which corresponded to the bestowal
of a modern military decoration.

V. THE CAMP.

The success of Roman arms in hostile and barbarous countries was
largely due to the custom of guarding against surprise by making
fortified camps. The summer camp (castra aestiva) and the winter
camp (castra hiberna) seem to have been alike in all essential
features. In the latter, however, more provision was made for the
comfort and convenience of the men. Instead of tentS, huts of tim-
ber and earth, thatched with straw or covered with hides, were pro-
vided for them. The camp was regularly in the form of a square,
often with rounded comem, but the lay of the land necessitated many
variations from the regular plan (see F ig. 1 19). Of all the camps of
Caesar that have been discovered, but one, that on the Aisne (Bk. ii.
5), approaches a square form. The site was chosen with great care,
and was always on high ground and near wood and water. An ideal
spot was the slope of a hill with some kind of natural defence on the
sides and rear, and with sufficient ground in front for the array of
the legions. Such a position would give the Romans an opportunity
for their favorite onslaught e superiore loco (cf. Bk. ii. 83 Bk. v. 50).

A small force of soldiers under centurions was sent ahead to select
the site for the camp and stake it out. Two bisecting lines were
drawn at right angles to each other to mark the four gates (see F ig.
119): the porta praetoria, facing the enemy; the porta decumana,

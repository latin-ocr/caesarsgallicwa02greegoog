103 19 latitudinem, etc.: Caesar’s passage of the Rhine was most
probably at Bonn, where the high and rocky banks begin3 or at Neuwied,
20 or 2 5 miles further south, where there is a break in the chain of hills,
though here, it is said, the bottom is rock, and not fit for driving piles.
The width of the river at either place is about 1400 feet, and its depth is
very variable. It is now cr'ossed in these parts by bridges.

103 21 rationem, plan. The brief description which Caesar gives of
his rough-and-ready but very serviceable engineering may be made clearer
by giving its different points as follows (see Fig. 59) ε -

1. A pair of unhewn logs, a foot and a half thick (tegna bina sesqutpb
dulia), braced two feet apart and sharpened at the end, are set up by
derricks and driven with pile drivers (fistucis) into the bottom, sloping a
little with the stream.

2. A similar pair is driven in opposite, 40 feet below, sloping a little in
the other direction against the stream; the upper ends of the two pairs
would thus be some 25 οι· 30 feet apart, the width of the roadway. It is
possible, as Riistow thinks, that the 40 feet refer to the top and not to the
bottom of the pileS.

3. A beam of square timber, two feet thick (trabs bipedalis), and about
30 feet long, is made fast at the ends by ties (fibulis) between the logs of
each pair, —which are thus kept at a proper distance apart‚ while they are
strongly braced against the current.

4. A suitable number (probably about 60) of these trestleS‚ or timber-
< archeS, having been built and connected by cross-tieS‚—this part of the
structure must be taken for granted,—p1anks are then laid lengthwise of
the bridge (directa materia), testing on the heavy floor·timbem; and upon
these, again, saplings and twigs (longurii‚ crates) are spread, to prevent the
jar and wear of the carts and hoofs of the pack-anirnals on the flooring.

among the Gauls as among the Greeks and Romans, mostly dispossessed
the old chiefs, or kings; and they had established an annual magistrate
called Vergobret (ch. 16). But the heads of the ruling families would
naturally be ambitious to recover what they could of the old class power,
and Orgetorix is represented as aspiring to create a monarchy in Gaul.

Latin has the power of putting various dependent clauses after a single
verb. Here the idea of persuading takes the thing that was to be done
in an ut·clause. The facts of which they were persuaded take the indir.
disc. Careful attention to this usage will make many difficult passages
easy. It is not the verb used, but the meaning, that decides the construc-
tion.—-cum praestarent: suij. after cum meaning since ,· ξ 549 (326),·

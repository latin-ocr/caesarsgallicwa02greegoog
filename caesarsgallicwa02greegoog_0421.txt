Si pacem p. R. cum Helvetiis saciet, in eam partem ibunt atque ibi erunt
Helvetii, ubi eos tu, Caesar, constitueris atque esse volueris (or Caesar con-

persons and tenses. In long passages, if that is omitted, parenthetical
phrases are frequently introduced to keep the connection of the thought,

desire them to be; but if they (the Roman people) should persist in pur-
suing them, etc., let him remember [he said] (or he begged him to remem-

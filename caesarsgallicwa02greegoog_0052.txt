VI. THE MARCH.

When thetrumpet gave the signal (szjgnum projectionis) to break
up camp (castra movere), the soldiers struck their tents and packed
their baggage (vasa conlzgere) ; at the second signal the baggage
(impedimenta) was put on the pack·animals and in the wagons;
at the third signal the army (agmen) began its march. The start
was made usually at sunrise, but it might be made earlier on special
’ occasion. The ordinary day's march lasted about seven hours, and
covered about 15 miles3 a forced march (magnum iter) about 25.
Caesar made many such, his men travelling immense distances with
incredible swiftneSS.

When marching in the enemy’s country, the main body of troops
(agmen) protected itself by a vanguard (agmen primum) of cavalry,
light-armed infantry, and scouts (exploratores), and by a rear guard
(agmen novissimum). Sometimes individual· spies (speculatores)
were sentvfar in advance to reconnoitre the country and the move-
ments of the enemy’s forceS.

The order of march of the main body depended on the nearness of
the enemy. When no enemy was near, each legion marched in a
single column and was followed by its baggage train (see Bk. ii. 17).
In the neighborhood of the enemy, a single column of troops in
fighting trim (expediti), i.e. without packs (sarcinae), followed
directly after the vanguard3 then came the baggage of the whole
army, while the remaining forces acted as a rear guard (cf. Bk. ii. 19).
SometimeS‚ for additional security against flank attackS, columns
of infantry marched on each side of the baggage train, forming a
hollow square (agmen quadratum ,· see Fig. 73). If, when marching
in this order, the army was compelled to halt and defend itself, the
soldiers, by facing about, presented to the foe a complete circle (orbis)
of armed men. When the foe was near and the ground level and
open, the march was sometimes made in three parallel columns, which,
by a simple evolution, could be quickly changed to the triple battle
line (acies triplex), the regular formation for an engagement.

Streams were crossed either by fords or bridgeS. Romans could
cross deeper fords than we, for they had no powder to keep dry

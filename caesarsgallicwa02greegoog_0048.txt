veteran was discharged with enough to provide for his old age.
Often he re'e’nlisted for farther service (evocatus).

b. making—All the legionaries were clothed alike. N ext the
skin was a nearly or quite sleeveless woollen shirt (tunica), reaching
nearly to the knees 3 over this a leathern coat strengthened by bands
of metal across the breast‚ back, and shoulders (lorica). In cold
or wet weather the soldier wore about him a wide woollen mantle
(sagum), which was fastened by a clasp (fibula) on the right shoul-
der, leaving the right arm free. At night the sagum served as a
blanket. About his·waist was a leather belt (cingulum militiae),
bound with metal and with strips of metal hanging from the front as
a protection to the lower partos the body. His feet were covered
with strong half-boots (calzjgae). This might be called his undress
’ uniform. See F igs. 107, 115, 126, etc. ⁸

c. Armor. — The defensive armor consisted of a coat·of-mail
(lorica, described above), a helmet, and a shield. The helmet (galea
or cassis), of iron or of leather strengthened with braSS‚ was open
in front and adorned with a white crest„which was one of the inszjg-

was a winged thunderbolt. See Figs. 1 16, 1 17, etc.

d. Weapons. — The weapons of offence were the sword and spear.
The sword (gladius Hispanus) was about two feet long, straight and
two-edged. It was used more for thrusting than for striking, and
was not usually hung from the body-belt, but from a belt passing over
the left shoulder to the right hip (balteus). See F igS. 17, 1 15, ete.

The spear (pilum) of. Caesar’s soldiers was between six and seven
feet long. The shaft was of wood and about =four feet long. Into
this was fitted the slender iron shank that ended in a barbed head.

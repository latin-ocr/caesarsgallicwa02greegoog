hurling distance about 100 feet. Each legionary had one of these
weapons. See F igS. 15, 107.

e. Baggage (Packs). — Besides his arms and armor, the legionary
carried tools for digging, cooking utensils (vasa), food for at least
two weeks (cibaria), his cloak or blanket (sagum), and usually one
or two stakes (valli) for the rampart of the camp. The weight of
the whole was about sixty poundS. For convenience in carrying, the
vasa, cibaria, and other small articles were tied in a compact bundle
to the end of a forked stick and carried over the shoulder. During
a halt this tested on the ground and the soldier could lean on it for
support. Upon a sudden call to battle he could quickly lay it down
and be ready (expeditus) for the fray. The forked sticks were
named Marius’s mules (muli Mariani), after the great Marius who
introduced their use. The collective personal baggage of the legion-
ary was called his sarcina (see F igS. 14, 1 15).

f. Food. — The sood provided for the legionary was coarse flour
or unground wheat or barley. This he must grind for himself. The
ration of food for one day was about two poundS. Every fifteen
days he received two modii‚—-about two peckS. This monotonous
diet was varied occasionally by meat and such food as he could find
by foraging3 and there was always the chance of bartering his ra-
tions for the greater variety carried by the traders (mercatores), who
followed the army in large numbers and did a thriving business with

’ the soldiers.

g. Work. —It has been truthfully said that Caesar conquered Gaul
as much with the spade and shovel as with the sword and spear. The
legionary was above all a skilful digger, and besides the actual fight-
ing, no small part of his labor was the almost daily task of fortifying
the camp (castra munire). At least three hours were needed for
this work. After this there were the watches to keep, the arms to
burnish, and all the other busy routine of camp life.

Ιι. Pay.— Caesar paid his legionaries 12½ cents a day or about
545 a year. This was nearly the same amount that a day laborer
could earn at Rome. The soldier was better off than the laborer
merely by his shelter and by the certainty of employment. A deduc-
tion from the pay was made for food and equipments furnished by
the state. F ood, however, was very cheap, and a soldier in active

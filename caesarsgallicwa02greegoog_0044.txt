xxxii Introduction.

6. The Baggage Train.

The baggage of the-army, except the packs corresponding to
knapsacks which the soldiers themselves carried (sarcinae), was
borne by horses and mules (iumenta), and in wagonS. The latter,
however, were used mainly by the traders (mercatores) and sutlers
(lixae) that followed the legion. The baggage of each legion was
by no means inconsiderable. It consisted of tentS‚ blankets‚ took,

the tormenta, provisionS, ete.‚ and required no less than 500 pack- .

animals to a legion. The inconvenience and delay occasioned by
the care of so much baggage caused the Romans to call it impedi-
menta (incumbrances), and a legion marching with its baggage
was called legio impedita ,⁰ when without, legio expedita. Along with
the baggage train went a multitude of driverS, groomS, officers‘
servants, and other menials, all of whom are included in the general
term calones. Most or all of these were slaves, See F igs. 14, 55.

7. The Officers and their staff.

The superior officers were: (1) the commander-in-chief (imperator
or dux belli). He possessed the imperium or supreme military
authority by virtue of his office, but by etiquette first received the
name imperator from his soldiers after his first victory. In Caesar's
case it was bestowed after his victory over the Helvetii.

(2) The legati. These were men of senatorial rank (i.e. who had
once held a curule magistracy). They were appointed by the senate
or the-people on the nomination of the proconsul. The senate also
determined the number that a general should have; Caesar had ten.
They often acted as ambassadors and made treatieS‚ but their chief
duties were military. Their powers were in no way independent, but ⁵
derived from the general, who might put them in command of one or
more legions or confer upon them the imperium in his absence
(legatus pro praetore). In his battle with Ariovistus Caesar placed
a legatus at the head of each of his legions (Bk. i. 53), thus giving
them an independent command, a practice which he afterwards con-
tinued to the great advantage of the service.

(3) The quaestores were officers elected by the people annually to
administer the financial affairs of the provinceS, one for each imperator.

Sacoun PAssAcm 01² ‘rna Rama—The last campaign had been a series of
disappointments and reverses. The expedition to Britain had been only moderately
successful and led to no permanent results; Caesar's return found the Gauls in a state
of unrest, which culminated in open revolt and in the annihilation of the division of
Sabinus and the attacks upon the winter quarters of Quintus Cicero and of Labienus.
Caesar, to be sure, rescued Cicero in the nick of time and Labienus was successful
against Indutiomarus3 but, on the whole, the advantage had been with the Gauls,
and they had gained fresh hope in their desperate struggle for independence. The
strength of their resistance was in the north and east, where they had the support of
raids from across the Rhine,—a danger which it was ‘especially the business of
Caesar to check by a daring blow; hence the policy of this new, but idle, advance
into Germany. It may be borne in mind that this campaign was the more critical,
as it followed closely upon the defeat and destruction of the Roman armies under

Crassus in the East.

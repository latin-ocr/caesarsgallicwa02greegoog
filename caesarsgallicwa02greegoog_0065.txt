gained but little detailed and accurate knowledge of the country, and
after him the Romans did not go there for nearly one hundred years.
Subsequently it was subdued and brought under Roman dominion.
England still shows many traces of the Roman occupatiori. Many
of her cities were founded by the Romans and bear Roman names.
After the Romans came the northern invaders, who drove out or
destroyed most of the original Celtic population. Those that survived
are represented to·day by the 1rish, the Welsh, and the Highland
Scotch‚ among whom a branch of the Celtic language is still spoken
to a considerable extent.

THE GERMANS.

THE Germans first appear in history in the campaigns of the
Cimbri and Teutones (13.c. 113-101), the latter of whom were
undoubtedly of Germanic origin. The Romans obtained their first
considerable knowledge of the country from Caesar. The ancient
limits assigned to it were less on the west and south, but indefinitely
greater on the east and north, than the modern. In those directions
it was terra incognita to the RomanS, and always remained so.
They never did more than subdue the border tribes along the Rhine
and Danube. Caesar had relatively little to do with the Germans‚‘
but made such investigations as he could, the results of which are
succinctly given in his narrative (Bk. iv. 1—3; Bk. vi. 21—28).
The next account, in greater detail, was given by Tacitus in his
“ Germania,” who corroborates Caesar in all important particulars.

The Germans were much less civilized than most of the Gauls.
They were just at the end of the nomadic stage, and were settling
down and beginning community life. Their last onward nomadic
’movement was that under AriovistuS‚ which it was Caesar's fortune
to arrest (Bk. i. 31-54). They were a more manly and vigorous
race than the GauIS, warlike‚ independent‚ and virtuouS. The
country is described as a dismal land, covered for the most part
with forests and swampS, producing little food, and subject to
almost constant winter.

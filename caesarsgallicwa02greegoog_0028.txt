proudest houses of Rome, he early showed his predilection for the
party of the people3 and the sturdy MariuS‚ with all his desecte,
doubtless exercised a marked influence over the life and destinies of
his young nepheW. Caesar lost his father early in life, so that most
of the responsibility sor his education and bringing up rested upon
his mother, Aurelia. She was a-typical matron of the old school,
managing her house with simplicity and frugality, and holding to the
traditions and virtues of the ancient RomanS. TacituS, the Roman
historiari, couples her name with that of Cornelia, the famous mother
of the Gracchi. Caesar owed much of his future greatness to her
influence, and his love and reverence for her are highly honorable to
both.

In the year 86, when Caesar was still a boy, he was appointed a
priest of Jupiter. This office was a perfunctory one and had little
real religious significance. In 83 he married Cornelia, the daughter
of Cinna, an act which identified him thus early with the Populares,-

obey Sulla’s command. A price was set on his head and he was
obliged to flee for his life. Osten he was in great peril, and once he

interceded for him, pleading his youth, and finally obtained his par·
don, Sulla saying, “ Take him, since you will have it so ; but I would
have you know that the youth for whom you are so earnest, will one
day overthrow the aristocracy. I see in him many MariuseS.”
Caesar thinking it safer to leave Italy for a time went to Asia
Minor, where he gained some military experience and distinguished
himself for valor by saving a comrade's life. Sulla died in 78 and
Caesar returned to his family and resumed his studies, He was a
diligent and thorough student and doubtless followed the usual course

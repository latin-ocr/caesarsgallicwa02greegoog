262 Notes .· Coesar. [B. G.

6 14 CHAP. 7. Caesari: the tendency is so strong in Latin to put the
most emphatic word first that it is so placed even when the first clause is
a dependent one, as here. We should say: Caesar, when it was reported,
etc„ hastened,· the Latin says: to Ccesar, wlzen it was reported, ete„ [he]
(which in such cases is unnecessary, having already been expressed' in a
different form) hastened. He was at this time at Rome, having laid down
his consulship, preparing to set out for his province. Every consul was
entitled to the governorship of a province for one year after his term of
office, and, by a special law, Caesar’s government (consisting of the three
provinces of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul and Illyricum) had been con-
ferred for a term of five years. The news of the emigration hastened his
movements. — nuntiatum esset: the same idiomatic use of the suij. with
cum as in 4 12. The relation here, however, is more apparent. The clause
gives not the time merely, but the circumstances, ‘⁶ upon this being,’' etc. —
id in apposition with eos . . . conari (the real subject of nuntiatum esset),
tlzat tlzey were attempting.

6 15 maturat: travelling‚ his biographers say, one hundred miles in a
day, and reaching the Rhone in a week, according to Plutarch. — ab urbe:
this word, unless some other place is indicated, always means Rome, THE
CITY. Caesar was near, but not in the city, not being permitted to enter
it while holding the military authority (imperium) of proconsul. Hence
he says ab, not ex. — proficisci: the so—called complementary infin„ used
like our own with verbs which require another action to complete their
sense.

6 16 quam maximis potest itineribus: §291. c (93. b); B. 240. 3; G. 3033
H. 159. 2 (170. 2); H-B. 241. 43 potest is usual with Caesar in this phrase,
which is elliptical. In full it would be tam magnis quam maximis, as
great as the greatest, i.e. tlte greatest possible. —ulterioremt i.e. beyond the
Alps. The northern part of modern Italy was still called Gallia Cisalpina,
and was a part of Caesar’s province.

6 17 ad, near to, as far as.—provinciae: dat.; ς 369 (227. f ); B. 187. ii. ας
G. 346; H. 426. 1 (385. i); H—B. 364. 4.—imperat: i.e. Transalpine Gaul.
Here impero is used in what seems to have been its original meaning, make
requisition upon ,· see Vocab.

6 18 erat omnino: cf. erant omnino, 5 6 and note.

6 19 legio: the tenth legion, which afterwards became so famous. With
reference to the Roman legions, see chapter on military affairs, 1. 1.

6 20 rescindi: notice that iubeo and veto, unlike other verbs of com-
manding and forbidding, take the acc. and the infin.

6 21 certiores facti sunt, were informed (made more certain) ε a tech-
nical expression for official communication or certain information.

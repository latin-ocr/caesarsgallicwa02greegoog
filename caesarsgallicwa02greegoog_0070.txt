lviii Introduction.

to render words mechanically, without thinking the corresponding
ideaS.

5. From the outset, notice that the emphatic position of words plays
a most important part in Latin writing‚ and try to feel the emphasis
of position as you read. (See § 595-601 (343-346), and compare
B. 348-351 ; G. 671-687; H. 663-685·(559-573); H—B. 620-630.)

As an illustration of ς 5 we append a translation of the first chap—
ter οἱ Book 11 with especial reference to the emphasis indicated by
, the order. As the translation is made expressly to bring out explicitly
the force of order, it should not be taken as a model oi desirable
translation. Such a translation as is here given forces the emphasis
on the attention more than is perhaps natural in English. Th‘e
force is all present in the Latin, but in English it may often be left
¹ to be brought out by the context or by some kindred emphasis which
the English substituteS. A short, easy passage from Book V is also
given without comment for study and practice.

continued to inform him that

stated, were conspiring [for an
attack] against the Roman gov-

¹ The emphasis on being binds this part of the narrative with the situation left at the end
of the last book, as if it were “ Caesar went to Hither Gaul, —and while he was engaged

there.'’

² Opposed to Fartleer Gaul, where the troops were.

⁸ The main subiect of discouise.

⁴ The repetition of the stories is the significant fact, ‘⁸ he kept hearing,” but at the same

time the rumors are opposed to Labienus's despatches.
³ An emphasis continued in Latin from Caesar, the main person, but lost in English.

See § 598. l (344. l) ; H—B. 627. 2.
⁶, ⁷ opposed to the rumors.

⁸, ⁹ Both words together the subject of discourse, but the adiective most prominent, “tlte

entire body ostlce Belgae.”

¹⁰ Opposed to the whole, as one might say, “a full tta-‘mi of the whole.‘’

The subject of this poterat is the indir. quest. quid . . . opus esset.—ab

quarter; but it is often impossible to say when the description of a situation
passes over into cause.- magno intervallo, confertissimo agmine: best
regarded as ablatives of manner, though we must remember that the
Romans did not trouble themselves about our classificationS. The ablative
*was the proper form for all these ideas; and so they used it for all without
distinction, as we should use in, at, or by.

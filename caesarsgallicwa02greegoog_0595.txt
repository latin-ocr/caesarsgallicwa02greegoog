vll. 56—64.] War of Verct'ngetorzlr. 437

227 1 altera, alteram: the Bellovaci were on the north of the Seine3
Camulogenus (ch. 57) was on the south—quae civitas: the defection of
this tribe might well cause Labienus uneasiness. They were a nation of
warriors and could put 100,000 men in the field. When the tribes of Belgic
Gaul conspired against Caesar, the Bellovaci, because of their importance,
were placed at the head of the league ; see 51 11-15.

227 4 praesidio: at Agedincum (Sens) on the other side of the Seine ς
see 224 23-26.

227 6 ab animi virtute: a truly Roman quality, of which, fortunately,
Labienus had a good supply.

227 9 CHAP. 60. equitibus: not cavalrymen, but unattached officers
of equestrian rank (tribuni militum, comites imperatoris, etc.) put in charge
each of a single vessel.

227 15 adverso flumine: a feint, the real attack being made below.—
imperat, gives orders (followed by the acc. and infin. instead of the usual
utaelause).

227 21 CHAP. 61. exercitus equitatusque: thought of as one body,
hence with a sing. verb.

227 25 tumultuari: the magno tumultu of 1. ι 5.

227 27 paulo infra: about four miles below.

228 2 Omit the bracketed words.

228 4 castrorum: the Roman camp.

228 6 naves: i.e. the lintris of 227 16, not the ships, for they had
gone the other way. ’

228 22 CHAP. 62. ostenderunt: sc. tribuni.

228 27 neque potuerunt, but could not. Much of Caesar's success was
due to the excellence of his officerS. In this case, for example, Labienus
does not supinely wait for Caesar to come and extricate him from his diffi-
cultieS, but by a military exploit of the first rank rescues himself and goes
to the help of his chief.

229 5 CHAP. 63. circummittuntur, etc.: these are the acts of the
Haedui.

. 229 7 quos Caesar, etc.: see 223 9, 22. —supplicio: i.e. by threats;

tion of affairs.

229 20 requirunt = recall with regret.

229 21 summae spei, oflngrh ambition (213 13-20).

229 24 CHAP. 64. ipse: i.e. Vercingetorix.

229 25 huc: at Bibrac⁴e, the capital of the Haedui.

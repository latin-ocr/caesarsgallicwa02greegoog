Referrin'g to this massacre of helpless fugitives, Plutarch, in his ‘⁴ Life of
Caesar,” writes that when the Senate was voting public thanksgiving and
processions on account of the victory, Cato proposed that Caesar should
be given up to the barbarians to expiate that breach of saith, in order that
the divine vengeance might fall upon its author rather than upon Rome.
Cato was Caesar’s bitter political and personal enemy, but still Caesar’s
cruelty and perfidy in this transaction can be justified only on the ground
of absolute necessity. To secure the Roman power, he must destroy these
Germans in order to establish the Rhine as the Gallie frontier and deter
others from crossing.

possible without doing violence to the text, and for this no sufficient case

is made out.

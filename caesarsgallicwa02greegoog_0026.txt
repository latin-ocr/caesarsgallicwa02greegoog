xiv Introduction.

steel, so that the election place was frequently stained with the blood
of the slain. It became increasingly difficult for one not possessing
and willing to use such means to be elected to any office.

Opposed to the lauded aristocracy was a class of wealthy capital-
ists known as equites, the ‘⁴ Equestrian Order.'’ Many of these
were as rich as the senatorS, but their wealth — most of it gained by
usury, state contractS, slave-dealing, and tax-gathering—consisted
of money instead of land. They took no active interest in politics
excepting so far as they could influence legislation to their advan-
tage by lobbying and bribing.

There was no industrious middle class among the free citizens of
Rome. Manufacture on a large scale, as a means of wealth, was
absolutely unknown ; while all mechanical industries were carried on
by slaves. The⁸poorer class of citize'nS, the plebs, were wholly influ-
enced in their votes by their wealthy patrons or by scheming dema-
gogueS. The freedmen were the only class who could become rich
by industry. ⁸

The rural portions of Italy were for the most part held in large
plantations (latzjfundia), owned by nobles and cultivated by slaveS,
or, more frequently, occupied by great droves of cattle. This plan-
tation system had crowded out the free peasant proprietors in almost
all parts of the peninsula. After throwing up their farms, which
foreign competition had made unprofitable, they flocked to Rome to
swell the idle mob that lived on what their votes would bring.
There still remained, especially in Northern Italy, a considerable
body of small land owners3 and the municipal towns (municzpia),
about four hundred in number, whose territories comprised, politi·
cally speaking, the whole area of Italy, were still the home of a
fairly prosperous middle class‚ These had all received Roman citi·
zenship after the social war (B.c. 90) and might, by their substantia]
character and intelligence, have served as a strong opposition to the
corrupt aristocracy at Rome 3 but they lacked organization and ·
leadership‚ and when they went to Rome to vote, they were wholly
powerless against the turbulent political clubs of the metropoliS,
whose violence was a regular feature of all public proceedings. Yet
in this class alone was the old Roman virtue to be found, and in
it lay whatever hope there was to redeem the state.

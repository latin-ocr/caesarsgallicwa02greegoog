Tun BELGIAN CONFEDERAcv.—The people of northern Gaul, including

Flanders and the Netherlands, were far remote from any country hitherto occu· ·

pied by the Roman arms. They lived amid forests and swamps hard to penetrate3
they claimed kindred with the German tribes rather than with the more fickle and
effeminate Celts; and they had a fierce and resolute spirit of independence, like that
which their descendants„ the Dutch, exhibited long after in the same regions against
the armies of Spain. The Belgian tribes, and particularly the Nervii, appear to
have offered to Gaesar a more formidable and desperate resistance than any he met
elsewhere until the great rising of nc. 52. When their spirit was once broken, the
conquest of the whole country was simply a question of time.

of a single colony or province merely —- and perpetual dictator (dic-
tator perpetuo), which offices clothed him with all the political.
authority of the state. By the powers thus conferred he laid the
foundations of the Imperial constitution, which was afterwards
(3.0. 30) set in operation by his grand-nephew and adopted son,
OctavianuS, later known as Augustus. Thi's scheme of government
eventually became (as was possibly foreseen from the start) an
hereditary monarchy, under the name and form of a republic. Dur-
ing the short period of Caesar's rule he continued the good work of
his first consulship and carried a series of measures of wise and prac-

them. These feelings culminated in a conspiracy against his life.
The leaders were CassiuS‚ a violent and fearless man driven mad by
jealousy and baffled ambition; and Marcus BrutuS, who had no
better friend than Caesar‚but who fancied that he must emulate his
ancestor, Brutus the first consul, who expelled the TarquinS. Caesar
received many warnings of what was going on, but disregarded them
all with his usual indifference to danger. The deed was consum-
mated in the senate-house on the Ides of March, B.c. 44. The
great dictator was struck down by false friends and fell, pierced
with woundS, at the foot of Pompey's statue. This dastardly act
received the condemnation it deserved‚ and few have dared to
defend it on the ground of patriotism. Those concerned in it all

Roman Military A ffairs. xxxi

Caesar placed little reliance on his auxilia for actual fighting, but
used them for the most part to make a show of force and {righten
the enemy (Bk. i. 51), and to assist in building fortificationS. In
engagements the bowmen and slingers were usually stationed on the
wings (alae), and from this were called alarii.

4. The Engineers and Artisans.

The engineers and artisans (fabri) sometimes formed a separate
corps under the command of a chief engineer (praefectus fabrum),
and sometimes they were called from the ranks of the legions when
their services were needed. Caesar had a chief engineer‚ but no
special body of men (cf. Bk. v. 11). They were employed in build-
ing bridgeS, shipS, winter quartem, and in repairing weapons and
equipmentS.

5. The Artillery.

Engines of war were not often used on the battlefield, where
modern artillery forms such an important branch of the service, but
mainly in the defence and assault of fortified cities or camps. They
had a limited use also in the fleet (Bk. iv. 25).

We have no exact account of the construction of these engines.
Caesar almost always calls them tormenta (cf. torquere, to twist), a
name which clearly points to the elasticity of twisted rope, sinew, or
hair, for the source of their energy. They were of three kinds:
catapultae, ballistae, and scorpiones (see Figs. 61, 7 5, 95). The cata-
pultae shot great arrows in a horizontal directim, like a cannon; the
ballzlrtae hurled great stones or heavy blocks of wood through the
air in a high curve, as a mortar throws shells. The range of these
weapons was from 1 500 to 2000 ft. A scorpio was a small catapult
having a range of about 350 ft. It was an accurate and deadly
weapon. Caesar tells of one at the siege of Avaricum that marked
and killed man after man in the same spot (Bk. vii. 25). The
γ tormenta were usually served and kept in repair by the fabri, but as
Caesar had no such corpS‚ they were probably in his army served by

legionaries.

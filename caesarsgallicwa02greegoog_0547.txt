133 10 CHAP. 24. Samarobrivae (locative) ε the chief town of the
Ambiani, whose name is found in the modern A miens.

133 12 aliter ac: i.e. distributing them where supplies were most abun·
dant, not where there was most danger of disturbance, as in previous years.

The location of these camps has been much disputed. The most com-
mon view puts Fabius at St. Pol, Cicero at Charleroi (or possibly Namur),
Roscius at Seez in Normandy, Labienus on the Ourthe (in Luxembourg),
Crassus, PlancuS, and Trebonius not far from AmienS, Sabinus and Cotta
at TongreS. These places do not quite agree with the description unless
we take the hundred mile limit (133 29) as the radius of a circle, a meaning
which seems improbable. But this division is perhaps near enough.

—Q. Ciceroni: the younger brother of the orator, and a man of tougher
fibre and of great military and executive ability. He had joined Caesar’s
army that very year and had taken part in the expedition to Britain. Quin-
ωε, like his brother MarcuS, sided with Pompey in the Civil War, and met
a similar fate in the same year (13.c. 43) at the command of the triumvirs.

133 20 proxime, latest. This was the 14th legion, enrolled in B.c. 57.

133 21 cohortis: these must have been troops not organized into a
legion, probably provincials.

134 7 restituerat: this aet of restoring chiefs exiled by the democraey
of the tribes was peculiarly odious to the GauIS, as here appears.

134 8 auctoribus (abl. abs.): i.e. either at their instigation, or, at any
rate, with their consent.

right time. He never admits the possibility of defeat and overcomes
the most stupendous difficulties with such ease that he rarely speaks
of them. His promptness of decision and rapidity of execution were
such that the enemy were constantly overwhelmed with awe and
were led to regard him as a supernatural being. ⁴ F orced marches,’
‘continuous marching day and night,’ ‘as quickly as possible ’ are

and one hundred and twenty lictors were in attendance, attached to
the several magistrates. At thisconference it was agreed that Pom-
pey and Crassus should hold the consulship the following year, and,
after their term of office, should receive by popular vote a similar
command to that held by Caesar,—namely‚ that Pompey should
command in Spain and Crassus in Syria for five years each3 also
that when Caesar’s five years were up, he should receive in the
same way a second term of five years, His ten years’ adminis-
tration would then close at the end of B.C. 493 after which time

VI1.86-90.] Close qs tlte Campazgn. 447

The trench twenty feet wide remains in its entirety. Of the pits (scrobes) in
which the sharp stakes were buried‚ more than fifty were discovered.
They are all three feet deep, two feet wide at the top, and one foot wide at
the bottom. Of course they do not retain the original dimensions. In the
trenches were found a great number of coins, Roman and Gallie, swords,
daggers‚ spear-headS, and the like. The result of these researches was a
very striking corroboration of Caesar’s narrative.

 

CLoss oF ‘rme CAMPAIGN.— If Caesar was merciless in war, he was
wise and humane in victory. Even in the moment of the fall of Alesia, he
uses his prisoners to make terms with the more important states (si per
eos, etc.). His aim was “not to enslave the Gauls‚ but to incorporate
thern in the Empire; to extend the privileges of Roman citizens among
them, and among all the undegenerate races of the European provinces.
He punished no one. He was gracious and considerate to all, and he so
impressed the central tribes by his judgment and his moderation that they
served him faithfully in all his coming troubles, and never more, even in
the severest temptation, made an effort to recover their independence.”

Caesar’s own narrative closes with the great and decisive victory at
Alesia. The short remainder of the story is told by his faithful officer and
friend, Hirtius Pansa, in the Eighth Book. A rising of the Carnutes and
Bituriges in the west, undeterred by the fate of Avaricum, was crushed by a
rapid winter march across the Loire. The Remi in the north, who alone of
the Gauls had been steadily true to Rome, were attacked by the Bel-
lovaci under Commius, but the latter were crushed in a single battle, and
Commius fled to Germany. The final rally of the patriot party was made
at the stronghold of Uxellodunum, on a branch of the Garonne‚ in the
southwest; but this was also reduced by a siege of extreme difficulty, and
the one act of vindictive barbarity which stains Caesar's record was inflicted
after its fall by cutting off the hands of the desperate defenders who had
held out to the last for the independence of Gaul. Caesar then “invited
the chiefs of all the tribes to come to him. He spoke to them of the
future which lay open to them as members of a splendid imperial state.
He gave them magnificent presentS. He laid no impositions either on the
leaders or their people ; and they went to their homes personally devoted
to their conqueror, contented with their condition, and resolved to main-

tain the peace which was now established—a unique experience in
political history.”
